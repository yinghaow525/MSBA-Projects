The fact that these are made with yogurt is a bonus.

I have never tried any other mixes nor have I made my own yet.  My daughter has a problem with wheat and I am attempting new things first for myself to see what I could feed her without her becoming discourage about certain types of food.  My daughter is only 19 months.<br /><br />First you should know I made this in a counter top oven/ toaster oven (black and decker x-large oven) in a 9x9 square analon (dark pan) so I used the 325 degree setting.  I kept a very close eye on this cake, because I didn't want to dry it out knowing it was going to be a totally different texture cake then I am normally used to with wheat.  It turned out good when I only left it in for around 21-25 minutes and then took it out and tested it with a toothpick in the middle (it came clean). Remember my heating elements are close to the food in this oven and it is a small cooking area.  I did exactly as the recipe called with the butter, vanilla, water and 3 eggs(egglands best x-tra large).<br /><br />The texture and aroma reminded me a little of corn muffin.  It isn't a complete texture like that but if I would have kept it in any longer it would have dried out and possibly tasted moreso like corn muffin.  I didn't mind it... I was really expecting something really different and possibly something I would totally snub.  But Hope is there.  It really wasn't bad.  I like vanilla cake over chocolate, so I would definatlely do it again.  It may be really good with a fruit, like cherry pie filling and COOL WHIP (NOT SURE IF EITHER IS GF).  I used the betty crocker ""fluffy white"" frosting which is also gluten free.<br /><br />GIVE THIS A CHANCE.  YOU MIGHT REALLY LIKE IT.  IF IT DIDN'T WORK OUT THE FIRST TIME AND YOU WANT TO PUT FORTH THE EFFORT AND TRY IT AGAIN KEEP AN EYE ON THIS ONE WHILE IN THE OVEN AND PULL IT OUT SOONER CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO DRY IT OUT.  I ALSO REMOVED IT FROM THE PAN WITHIN 5 MINUTES OUT OF THE OVEN, SO IT WOULDN'T CONTINUE TO COOK IN THE PAN.  I HOPE THIS HELPS.  BEST WISHES AND GOOD LUCK.<br /><br />IF ANYONE TRIES OR HAS TRIED THIS USING OIL INSTEAD OF BUTTER, LET ME KNOW HOW IT CAME OUT.  I'M SURE THERE IS A GOOD REASON WHY BETTY CROCKER WANTS US TO USE THE BUTTER.  I WOULD ALSO BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING IF THEY ARE PRODUCING THIS PRODUCT IN A GLUTEN FREE FACILITY.  MAYBE THEIR WEBSITE WILL TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  I'LL HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT SOON."

I saw the video for this product, and definitely agree that carrying a pocketful of crumbling treats isn't much fun for training/rewards, so decided to give it a try.  All 3 of my girls tried to bite the bottle at first (and I think most dogs will), but within a few seconds, all of them figured it out, and were licking away very happily, each taking their turn sitting down for me.  I also recently used it to help keep them standing still while my 8 year old daughter gave them baths outside with the hose on a nice warm day....much less mess than doing it in the tub inside!  It was also handy when we went for a short hike at a local park a while back, as I am training the 2 younger Danes to wear backpacks (that's a whole other story!).  Even if the dogs jump in the river wearing their backpacks and get them soaked, their treats won't get soggy.  The only thing I would like to see is using a liquid treat that's maybe a bit healthier for them...the ingredient list on the Lickety Stik looks like a lot of processed stuff.  It does have a bit of an odor, too, but I didn't find it that strong or offensive like some of the other people here did.  And I think it's the odor that really draws the dogs to come check it out...otherwise, why would they want to just lick a plastic roller ball?<br />Also, I think it would be nice to have a bottle that is just a little bit larger for the large/giant breeds like mine...but this does work well regardless.  Finally, I think it would be great to have a refillable bottle, so there would be less waste...500 licks goes fast when you're training 3 big dogs!<br />Oh, and yes, I will re-order this, and do recommend it."

Thanks to this company, I don't have to do that anymore - AND I can control the sugar amount!<br /><br />Upon pouring out the contents of the robustly-flavored Caramel Green Matcha from the non-resealable, gold foil packaging into the tin, I could smell the sweetness of caramel. I HAD to make a bowl right then and there!<br /><br />For this first preparation I sifted a teaspoon of matcha powder into my bowl - I highly recommend doing this! Without it, you risk the chance of having clumpy matcha, and no one wants that! I wisked in two ounces of warmed water with my electric frother until the matcha was fully dissolved. Filled the bowl with the rest of the warmed water, about 6 ounces worth.<br /><br />I found the caramel missing an element - maybe it's sweetness, which is something I usually associate with caramel. While Red Leaf Tea doesn't add any sugar to their matchas, I found this benefited from some added sweetener.<br /><br />I also think I might prefer the Caramel Matcha prepared as a sweeter latte - either hot or cold.<br /><br />I do look forward to playing around with the Caramel Matcha more - mixing it with other flavored matchas from this company. Caramel Cheesecake, Caramel Green Apple, Caramel Espresso, Caramel Vanilla, just to name a few! Oooo and I bet baking with this is going to be AMAZING!"

They smell good too, when you first open them. Like actual oatmeal raisin cookies! The texture is nice and soft, with a walnut crunch. These are higher quality bars than most. Unlike most snack bars, they don't leave an unpleasant taste in your mouth afterwards. I do not like oatmeal raisin cookies, but I did enjoy eating one of these bars for testing. I actually ate the entire thing and was surprised at what a quality product it was. (Heated in the microwave--out of the wrapper-for a few seconds, it was almost like a cookie straight out of the oven!)<br /><br />Having said that; they have 24 grams of carbohydrates per bar and 2 grams of fiber. I was surprised that they only had 9 g of sugars considering the second ingredient (agave) is the equivalent to corn syrup. Yes yes I know, ""It's natural!"" But look and see how it's processed, it's no different. One has a health label and the other doesn't. For those watching their sugars, they are the same and should be noted.<br /><br />If you are on a gluten-free diet because of health reasons, you will really enjoy these bars! If you are gluten free and also sugar-free, these aren't going to be a regular item for you. If you want a delicious snack bar that tastes pretty close to homemade, and you don't label your eating style, then you will like these bars! One bar is filling and delicious. Soft raisins and crunchy walnuts, if you are going to buy ANY snack bars, these are worth the money over other grocery store products!"

My son was given this formula in the hospital as there were some initial problems and he immediately liked it. Then I had switched him to the powdered one which gave him colic for one and half month which I did not realise was a reason until someone pointed out the same problems with her kiddo. I had tried the Similac and nestle Goodstart powder but my son would not take the Similac and had severe spit up with nestle good start. Once I switched him to this ready to feed formula he was a different person and had no more problems.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Easy to use as ready to feed and also helps when travelling.<br />2. No colic problems with my son.<br />3. Must be close to breastmilk as my son never says no for this one.<br />4. Also available in 6oz and 8oz sizes.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. Expensive<br />2. Small shelf life once opened.<br />3. 32 oz cans do not come in a bottle or can that can be closed so I had to get the lids which I could only find on amazon so that I can put the open ones in the  refrigerator.<br />4.

Their precooked smoked turkey is excellent. But I did not enjoy this prime rib. Why? I bought the 4-5 lb roast for Christmas dinner. I let it thaw in the refrigerator for 4 days and then set it on the counter for two hours to bring it up to room temperature so it would reheat evenly. I followed the instructions that came with the roast, preheated the oven and let it cook for about an hour at 350 degrees. As I was busy preparing the rest of the meal I felt confident the prime rib would turn out fine since it was already cooked. As I was finishing up the rest of the cooking in that last dash of chaos to get everything out on time I finally checked the temperature of the meat and was shocked to find it was only 80 degrees in the center!<br /><br />I know for a fact the entire prime rib was thawed so there is no way it was still cold in the middle before I put it in the oven. I didn't panic. Since my guests were waiting and everything else was finished I had to get this meat up to temperature quickly (to at least warm) in the center without ruining the perfect red color of medium rare. Unfortunately that meant putting this beautiful and EXPENSIVE piece of meat in the microwave. I had to run it on high for 1 minute intervals, constantly opening and closing the door until I got the center to 110 or so - at least so my guests thought it was warmed through. Because of how big the roast was, that process took about 10 extra minutes. Obviously it is impossible to cook a prime rib evenly in the microwave so I ended up with overcooked ends, well done second and third slices and a slightly pink center.<br /><br />As for the taste...what were they thinking? I tasted like it was injected with highly concentrated au jus. Each bite was too salty for my taste and there was a heavy flavor of beef broth and rosemary. I wanted to taste the beef, not the seasonings. It reminded me a little of carved roast beef you get in a cheaper chain buffet restaurant or cafeteria like Golden Corral.<br /><br />Are there any positives? Yes, I can't say I hated it outright. The meat itself was tender as a prime rib should be and the flavor while a bit overpowering, was edible. In fact, my in-laws said they liked it a lot (but maybe they were just being nice). Also, it was much bigger than I thought - that's a good thing. It easily fed 6 people and there was enough left for another 5 or 6 more slices.<br /><br />But for the $115 I paid I probably could have had the same results from my grocery store meat case. Sorry Burgers. I like your products but you blew it on this one. I won't be buying a precooked prime rib from you again."

I was curious about it's potential benefits so I did more research. I was very surprised to learn how this oil had been the primary source of oil in the United States until there was a propagandist pitch against buying this oil due to conflicts of the world war at the time, as well as the increased interest in corn oil manufacturing in the U.S. Coconut oil became a target of U.S. corn and vegetable oil manufacturers. Today, it's nearly been forgotten or written off because of it's high saturated fat content.  Interesting to note that this oil's properties do not act like other saturated fats because it is a medium-chain triglyceride, which breaks down differently in the liver. After reading the information I gave it a go and I love it.  It is great for all sorts of cooking. It even blends well into a protein shake. It smells wonderful and works as a great skin conditioner and massage oil.  I would highly recommend coconut oil to everyone. Once you try it you won't want to go back to the unhealthy corn or vegetable oils."

The recipes I've used xylitol in come out great - the flavor and texture are uncompromised. I most often use xylitol with rapudura sugar in my recipes. I do this because some of my friends are sensitive to xylitol's mild laxative affect. I personally don't react to xylitol in that way, but I do have a couple of friends that experience bloating after eating my brownies that have xylitol substituted for the sugar. So, now I substitute 1/2 xylitol and 1/2 rapudura sugar in my cookie and brownie recipes and my friends don't have any adverse intestinal response. (Yay!)  Also, when eating desserts with xylitol, I don't experience a ""sugar headache"". I have had no adverse reactions while using this product. It's a fantastic sugar substitute."

Drinking water must come in a bottle and be collected from some important and well-known springs. Besides, she seems to have elevated senses in taste, smell, sight, hearing and all other senses.

It costs several times as much as regular brands, but that's part of the appeal. It's the best, she claims. It's so smooth and goes down so easy, she says.

Highly recommended to those interested in making cold process soaps with lye.<br /><br />I have also started using it as a replacement for ""vegetable oil"" in recipes.  I don't feel comfortable using actual vegetable oil (which is usually soybean oil), and I usually substitute with olive oil...but sometimes I don't want things to taste like olive!  This grapeseed oil has a very light flavor that does not affect the taste of recipes.  I also feel good about the high smoke point; this makes it an ideal oil for use in cooking and baking."

I haven't tried it internally yet, but the external use has been amazing.  I have keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) on my arms (upper and lower), legs, and butt (yay, me!).  I've only ever found one cream by Lush that made any difference, and it was very expensive.  Enter, coconut oil! First, you will notice that it comes as a solid (unless the temperature is above 72 degrees, then it melts, which is ok, don't panic).  You take a bit and rub it between your hands and it melts instantly.  You're going to think first: oh yuck, I'm not putting this on my body! But please do: rub it anywhere and everywhere.  You'll notice how at firstit doesn't seem to be sinking in, but if you wait about ten minutes, it will do just that.<br /><br />I should also mention I have a sensitive skin on my face, which despite proper exfoliating, sheds skin often.  I get dry patches that, when at their worst, act like burns that open and are painful.  I know, pretty gross.  I'm usually cautious about trying new products on my face because it's so sensitive.  For years I've been using Eucerin, but it's not always enough.<br /><br />I through caution to the wind and slatered my face with the coconut oil.  It felt pretty gross at first, but within ten minutes it started to sink it.  I was nervous that I would wake up in the morning with oil-induced acne, but that didn't happen.  What did happens was that it had sunk in completely and my face was the smoothest and softest I'd ever seen.  Honestly, I couldn't stop touching my face!  Of course this meant my makeup went on better, and I looked...I don't know...I guess the word is well-rested.<br /><br />Another HUGE bonus is that while the dots on my arms still look like they're there, my keratosis pilaris is all but gone!  My arms, legs, (and yes, butt) are the softest and smoothest I've ever seen them.  I can't believe this worked! As you're working the oil into your skin, don't forget to rub it into your nails and eyelashes too.  I swear my eyelashes look longer andI know my nails are definitely stronger.<br /><br />Lastly, this product is CHEAP, you really can't go wrong with it.  I have two tubs of it, one for my body and the other for my diet (the thought of using one for both grossed me out). I'll let you know how that goes.<br /><br />Anyway, consider this a five-star, two thumbs way up review!"

Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.<br /><br />You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!"

However, the price is kind of high if you have to use two pods per cup.<br /><br />UPDATE: Today, I tried using two pods and boiling them in a cup of water, thinking it might work for camping. Still weak. I think you'd need two pods and half a cup, 4oz or so. I noticed that the coffee does not taste full-bodied.

I added two teaspoons to my regular cup of coffee and it was delicious.

Period.<br /><br />I had to break down and purchase a Tasimo machine and the coffee to go with it (lots of plastic waste in the little cups) but I digress . . . so I've been 2 months with this new machine, and what arrives at my door last week ????  A CRAPlOAD of Senseo coffee pods!!!!!

I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply."

When I smell bread burning in a toaster, I always think of my Mom in our kitchen making an afternoon snack. No toast is complete without orange marmalade. Ordinary jelly will not do! The only brand acceptable is Keiller's Dundee orange marmalade made with an authentic recipe dating back to 1797. Imposters, like the watery Bonne Maman of France and the Swiss Hero varieties, can't compete with the real thing. Since 1988, Keiller's has been manufactured in the Robertson's plant in Manchester, England (horrors!) The taste is still intact.

I blend smoothies very often (thanks to the book Green for Life for giving me many recipes to play with).  Usually I blend up greens, bananas, strawberries, and add flax oil, hemp protein, and nutritional yeast.  Adding a tablespoon of these seeds adds quite a nice dose of nutrition.<br /><br />Most seeds and nuts are high on fat, and these are no exception (50% fat by volume).  But for most diets the pros outweigh the amount of fat.  Plus, a little healthy fat is necessary in a balanced diet.<br /><br />They taste great.  Very mild.  They are great for baking, topping oatmeal or cereal, putting in a cup of almond milk, adding to smoothies (of course), or just eating raw.  You can also soak them in water for a bit to make a nice paste (which is a good way to use it in baking recipes also).<br /><br />The packaging is nice.  There is not a ton of wasted space, the seeds fill the entire bag.  They are USDA organic.<br /><br />I highly recommend them as a source of alternative nutrition, especially for vegetarians and vegans, but for anyone really."

I use a pot that has a screen basket in the middle to hold the bags, so I don't want the strings in there as well ... I became accustomed to being able to yank the strings off the bags of the individually packaged bags, but doing the same thing with these bags tears the top of the bag (which isn't an issue for making the tea, just for cleaning the basket afterwards) ... so now I cut the strings off with a scissors ... a trivial thing, but I thought I would pass it along in case anyone cares.<br /><br />So ... if you like Bigelow Earl Grey ... and if you make your tea by the pot, or if you use more than 1 tea bag per day, then this is the way to go!"

This is actually not a green tea; it is a blend of green tea and black tea.  I found it to be more characteristic of black tea, albeit with a soft, flowery aroma and suggestions of fruit and vanilla in the flavor that I think reflected the addition of the green tea (green and black teas are not different kinds; it just depends on how they are processed).<br /><br />I'm not quite a tea snob, but I probably come pretty close.  I drink tea every day, both iced and hot, and have for most of my life (my parents never thought children should have coffee, but we often drank tea).  I'm careful about how I steep my tea and use water of different temperatures and different brewing times for different teas, depending on their requirements for optimal flavor.  I have definite tea preferences, although they are wide ranging, and I buy many high-end teas (although good old Red Rose finds its way into my iced tea regularly).<br /><br />I found this a very pleasurable, very drinkable tea.  I brewed it with just-boiling water, as I would a black tea, but steeped it for only about 3 minutes (note that I like my tea dark).  It put me in mind of a darjeeling but was more complex and, I think, benefited from the smoothing influence of the green tea.  The earthiness that is claimed to be typical of Puerh tea was definitely present, but very mellow.<br /><br />This is my first experience with Puerh tea, so I did a little reading on it.  It really does have a long history and is one of the first Chinese teas; tea trees known to be more than 1000 years old are still growing and producing tea.  Puerh tea comes from the Yunnan province, one of the most ideal tea growing regions in the world.  It's reputed to dispel the effects of alcohol, help digestion, refresh the mind, and lower cholesterol and triglycerides (wow, what's not to like!)<br /><br />I don't know if it really does have greater health benefits than other teas, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to add it to my tea lineup, and I believe it will continue to hold a place there.  Actually, writing this review has made me want to drink it again, so I think I'll go brew a pot!"

They tasted like their about to go stale. I tried a different flavor just to double check and though it tasted alittle better it was also tasted like it was close to its expiration date. I gave it to some friends to try because taste is a personal preference. They told me that it didn't taste as fresh and was alittle stale. A friend referred me to this brand of chips.

The results were encouraging. Participants, drinking the cherry juice, showed significant reductions in known markers of inflammation and lower levels of triglycerides (blood fats) and LDL cholesterol -- both known risk factors for heart disease.<br /><br />Researcher, Dr. Mitch Seymour, who led an animal study at the University of Michigan, in which tart cherries were again found to lower inflammation, said: ""Chronic inflammation is a whole body condition that can affect overall health, especially when it comes to the heart. This study offers further promise that foods rich in antioxidants, such as cherries, could potentially reduce inflammation and have the potential to lower disease risk.""<br /><br />To start with, tart cherries can aid muscle recovery following exercise. A study published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine revealed that strength loss and pain following exercise were significantly less in the cherry juice trial compared to the placebo trial. Most notably, strength loss averaged over the four days after exercise was 22 per cent with the placebo but only 4 per cent with the cherry juice-drinkers.<br /><br />Several earlier studies have confirmed that tart cherries offer benefits for patients with autoimmune, neurodegenerative and connective tissue diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes. Studies show that tart cherries not only reduce pain and inflammation but also offer protection against cancer. These effects are attributed to the high amounts of plant phytochemicals, known as anthocyanins, they contain.<br /><br />Research has shown that a diet containing cherries is beneficial in reducing the risk of colon cancer. When researchers fed a diet containing tart cherries, anthocyanins, or cyanidin (a non-sugar breakdown product of anthocyanins) to mice with a genetic susceptibility to colon cancer, the animals developed significantly fewer and smaller colon tumours. This study also revealed that these compounds effectively reduced the growth of two human colon cancer cell lines.<br /><br />The cancer-protective benefits of this fruit were validated in another experimental study, in which cherry fruit extract reduced the growth of both human colon cancer cells and human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent fashion.<br /><br />Researchers have suggested that a possible mechanism by which cherries may confer these benefits is through shutting down the growth of cancer cells by depriving them of the proteins they need to grow.<br /><br />Supporting melatonin levels and brain health<br /><br />Tart cherries are one of the few food sources of melatonin, a chemical released in the body by the pineal gland that is closely connected with the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin also acts as a powerful antioxidant, providing neuro-protective and immune-modulating effects.<br /><br />Ongoing scientific studies are demonstrating how foods naturally rich in melatonin - like Montmorency cherries - can help sufferers of insomnia gain deep, restful sleep.<br /><br />Tart cherries are also rich in phenolic compounds, which have strong neuro-protective activity. In a laboratory setting, cherry phenolics protected neuronal cells from cell-damaging oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. Tart cherry compounds may therefore play an important role in protecting ageing adults against neurodegenerative conditions such as memory loss, senile dementia, and perhaps even Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br />Give it to me!<br /><br />Why do people use tart cherries and tart cherry juice?<br />Both sweet and tart cherries and cherry juice have long been used by traditional healers as a folk remedy for gout, because cherries are thought to lower urate levels in the body.<br /><br />Tart cherries are used for conditions involving inflammation and pain, such as:<br /><br />* arthritis<br />* gout<br />* muscle pain<br />* back pain<br />* diabetes<br />* neurodegenerative diseases<br /><br />Both sweet and tart cherries contain phenolics, naturally-occurring plant compounds that have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant effects.<br /><br />The main type of phenolic in cherries is called anthocyanins. In general, the darker the cherry color, the higher the anthocyanin content.<br /><br />Anthocyanins have been found to block two enzymes, COX-1 and COX-2, which play a role in the production of inflammatory compounds called prostaglandins. Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen and ibuprofen also work this way.<br /><br />In test tube studies, cherry anthocyanins have been found to protect neurons from damage by oxidative stress. However, there have been no studies that have looked at whether cherry extracts could prevent or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease in humans.<br /><br />Both Balaton and Montmorency tart cherries contain relatively high levels of the antioxidant melatonin compared to other foods. Montmorency cherries contain approximately 6 times more melatonin than do Balaton cherries.<br /><br />Are tart cherries more effective than sweet cherries?<br />Generally, tart cherries have been found to have higher concentrations of phenolics and anthocyanins than sweet cherries.<br /><br />Tart cherries are also slightly lower in sugar. Half a cup of sweet cherries contains 9.3 g of sugar and 46 calories, compared to 6.6 g of sugar and 39 calories in tart cherries.<br /><br />However, there is no real evidence that these differences are significant-both types of cherries are very high in anthocyanins compared with other foods.<br /><br />It may be that we are hearing more about the health benefits of tart cherries because of the way they are marketed. In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration sent warning letters to 29 cherry farmers and distributors for positioning tart cherries on their websites as a medicinal food that could possibly help people with gout, arthritis, diabetes, and prevent cancer.<br /><br />What research has been done on tart cherries?<br />Although anthocyanins, which are also found in blueberries and other purplish-red fruits and vegetables, are known to be powerful antioxidants, no studies have looked at whether cherries--tart or sweet--can relieve symptoms of arthritis, gout, or diabetes outside the lab.<br /><br />All studies involving cherries have been very small, so we'll have to wait to see whether tart cherries are beneficial and in what quantities. In the meantime, here are a few of the studies that have been conducted so far:<br /><br />* A small randomized controlled trial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine examined the effectiveness of a tart cherry juice blend in preventing symptoms of exercise-induced muscle damage. Fourteen male college students drank 12 fl oz of a cherry juice blend or a placebo, twice per day for eight consecutive days. Strength loss was significantly lower in people taking the cherry juice (4%) compared with the placebo (22%). Pain was also significantly lower in people taking the cherry juice.<br /><br />* Jill M. Tall, Ph.D., research fellow at Johns Hopkins, was the lead researcher of a study that tested the effectiveness of orally administrated anthocyanins from tart cherries on inflammation-induced pain in rats. The results of the study suggested that tart cherry anthocyanins may have a beneficial role in reducing inflammatory pain.<br /><br />* One small study published in the Journal of Nutrition supported the anti-gout effectiveness of cherries. assessed the effects of Bing cherry (a sweet cherry) consumption on healthy women and found that cherry consumption decreased blood urate levels, and there was a marginal decrease in inflammatory markers c-reactive protein and nitric oxide."

There is a bit of confusion over the UMF, MGO and OMA rating thing.  UMF is the original and trademarked.  MGO is a newer rating system that does not directly correlate to UMF but is accurate nonetheless.  OMA is Wedderspoon's own rating system for determining activity within the raw honey. From my reading it appears to be pretty equitable to UMF.  This honey is also USDA Organic certified (although that doesn't mean as much these days) to ensure that there are no additive ingredients to the product.<br /><br />As for usage, I have two jars of this honey.  I used the first on my wife's wounds following MOHS surgery for removal of skin cancer.  The results were amazing and the surgeon and plastic surgeon both asked what we were using to allow the wounds to heal up so quickly with minimal scarring.  There was also a staph infection as a result of the surgery that the honey took care of as well.  It takes a bit of diligence to ensure daily dressing changes with fresh honey, but the results pay off.  I ended up pre-soaking gauze with the honey and sandwiching between two layers of plastic wrap to create more manageable ""bandages"".  These were used by my wife when she traveled in addition to direct application to the cleaned wound bed.<br />Basic process: Clean wound with Hydrogen Peroxide, follow with colloidal silver in nebulizer, then drizzle honey into wound and cover wound with pre-soaked gauze pad.  The last bit is to cover the pre-soaked pad with a waterproof dressing like a Telfa-style pad to reduce oozing onto clothing/bedding.  Care must be taken in finding adhesives that do not irritate the skin too much with the frequent dressing changes.  There are also larger waterproof wound dressings with silver-impregnated that might be a good combination.  Main idea is to minimize air-space and keep honey in constant contact with wound bed.<br /><br />If this all sounds new, do some research on honey for wound care at the University of Waikato in New Zealand courtesy of Dr. Peter Molan.<br /><br />Note, this honey is not ""sterilized"" via gamma radiation (which is not supposed to reduce activity in the honey like pasteurization) but is still highly effective.  Honey is resistant to most any spoilage due to its activity and the sterilization process is just an extra step some honey manufacturer's take (Comvita or Summerglow) to be able to sell their products as medical devices in the US.  It will allow the honey to be FDA-approved.  Again, as I understand this is not a requirement but is done largely to gain approval for medical usage in hospitals and clinics.  Check out Medihoney dressings. BTW, I have also used this topically on oral canker sores with great effect! Sores dissappeared in days and not weeks! Applied directly 3 x day.<br /><br />Lastly, the other jar I use for tea and even coffee and it is delicious.  It has a strong floral taste and finish (as would be expected) and is alittle more viscous than other Manuka honeys I have tried.<br /><br />I have tried nearly all Manuka honey brands from NZ as I visit often and find this to be a great option for those of us who need a high-quality active raw Manuka honey without paying a load for shipping up the stuff from down under.  Or you can just ask a friend heading that way to bring you back some :P"

I prefer a kosher dill over straight dill and really like the Vlasic and Claussen brands the best.  So, BIGS being a Vlasic pickle flavor really worked for me.  I think these seeds have a ton of kosher dill flavor.  The other brands taste more like a lighter straight dill flavor.  I'd personally rather eat straight sunflower seeds than eat the other two brands.  I also think that the BIGS brand have larger seeds than the other two (particularly David's....I've always thought David's seeds were too small).<br /><br />If you like Kosher Dill pickles and sunflower seeds, I don't think there's anyway you could be disappointed with these seeds.

I began to look at animals differently...she truly became even more my my ""baby"" each day.<br /><br />Now let me backtrack into the day I decided to begin researching dog food with this baby in my life...<br /><br />I was a physician recruiter and had to visit a hospital in a town in Texas where they have more cows per capital than anywhere else in the U.S. in order to utilize them for human consumption.  I had several tours of this town and found out by the owners of several companies that it was no accident one of the largest dog food manufacturers is also here. (It is not Newmans own...bear with me)<br /><br />At first that sounds good to you, doesnt' it? That they must be using, for this other company, food grade meat in their dog food? Well, I personally, first hand, watched bull dozers pick up dying and dead cattle. I was proudly told how smart it was that THESE cows are then taken to the dog food plant. (remember, this is NOT Newman's Own, it was what lead me to find Newman's Own) (!) I had many conversations about this...no they dont find out what's wrong with the cows. They are the cancerous, diseased, unhealthy cows that go into this other maker's food. I was appalled. And yes, I was told how great it was because they buy them for nothing from the cattle company and no they aren't supposed to...but they can and they were ever so proud.<br /><br />Fast forward to a couple years ago with the dog food recall when pets were dying from diseased meat being in their food because of this very reason...cows with diseases so bad that it made pets die got into many brands of the cheap commerical dog foods.<br /><br />The reason why Newman's Own was one of a handful of companies who had no recall? They are one of the few companies that use FDA certified HUMAN GRADE meat. See label.<br /><br />Yep, they are allowed to put things that are not allowed to be eaten by humans in most other dog foods...unless you find a company that uses food grade meat. Most people dont know this!<br /><br />Better yet, Newmans' own uses organic.<br /><br />I'll be honest, I dont use this food all the time. I learned about it from someone who shows Pomeranians and uses this because her dogs coats look better because it helps their health. I actually make a lot of my dog's food after my day at the cattle plant that I unwittingly visited. But I am not always long on time and when I find myself there, I use these or a dry dog food that's organic and human grade from Flint River Ranch, another company a vet told me about.<br /><br />Okay so on to my studies for the past 5 years in dog health. This became fascinating to me...many vets found that many health related issues with dogs began (or multiplied) when commercial dog foods began being made for convenience. Think about it...not only are they suddenly not getting food grade food unless you buy something like Newman's Own, but humans are told how bad processed food is, yet dogs eat the same thing each day, processed food. Many vets are on board to change this in spite of the fact that most veterinary schools are funded by the major dog food manufacturers...so...you figure that out...<br /><br />(p.s. in the old days dogs got table scraps...but these table scraps were in the days before humans ate processed foods with artificial ingredients and preservatives...so dogs eating the meats and vegetables were healthier than today when we buy special food for them!  But bear with me...Newman's Own has changed all this!)<br /><br />So anyhoo...the best place for info is to go to dog shows and ask about diet because health is studied here for coat and longevity and ease in litters etc when it's thier living and life. I have yet to meet a champion who eats commercial dog food unless it's organic with the balance of minerals,veg, good carbs, etc. like Newman's Own. Many also do a raw diet with veg and brown rice.)<br /><br />Many of the minerals needed in the commercial brands are actually added then baked out and many have cornmeal as the main ingredient because it's cheapest...<br /><br />if you look at the nutritional info on Newman's own, even if you don't care that it's human grade and organic, you will see that the balance of protein, vitamin, minerals, etc is ALL the exact measure now studied by dog health experts as ideal.  This is hard to find.<br /><br />So, should you, too, have a dog that is a member of the family, my 5 years of research has led me to praise the Newman's Own label (even for what I eat for myself in their other HUMAN grocery products!) and if you want to supplement this dog food with home cooked meals the best guide to curing your dog through a diet natural to what they need is Dr Pitcairn's book of natural health for dogs and cats. (get the most recent edition if you do; he updates them the more he researches.) He's studied this far more than I'll ever be able to and is a top vet who teaches other vets about what they dont learn in vet school: major PREVENTATIVE measures through natural diet.<br /><br />He began his own quest when someone brought in either a wolf or coyote and he made the connection that whenever he saw wild dogs they didn't have teeth with tartar build up and so many health issues that our house dogs who aren't outside as much wind up with--then he started tracing back to when some of the cancers and skin problems etc began and it was with the emergence of commercial cheap dog food. Coyotes get veg from the tummies of what they kill, there are minerals, things they need from bones, there are things that naturally prevent tartar, fleas etc that we have removed from the diet of our house dogs. (my own dogs now have coats so shiny strangers comment each time I take them out...and p.s. we live in the woods and they have no fleas!)<br /><br />I, personally, have helped friends CURE ""health"" issues in their pets that were actually food issues that their vets kept ""treating"" without ever suggesting they change to a natural diet. They spent tons on medicine for skin problems etc then at my prodding gave them GOOD dog food and ""cured"" them!<br /><br />Newmans Own has taken dog food out of the profit center and into care. While it can't cure all ails as much as balanced vitamin enriched homemade food may in my opinion, it is a staple in my pantry. I also use Flint River Ranch at the recommendation of my vet who studies the same issues. He loves them both.<br /><br />I am a raving fan.<br /><br />and, p.s. no I have no monetary interest in this company which isI why I also recommended other food options and brands...but I care enough about animals to be long-winded due to my years of study on it."

My mother, being the thrifty person that she was, always bought huge quantities of economy tea to make her beloved iced tea. Not until I was almost 18 did I actually touch the stuff, and even then, only in small, desperate measures to drink anything but water. Only recently, after a trip abroad where the beverage choices were beer, tea, or coffee did I decide to become rightfully acquainted with the least of the three evils (and the one with the most flavor options): tea. With this in mind, understand I am not a tea connoisseur, but I know what tastes horrible and this is it.<br /><br />I found Twinings in Europe, specifically, their Green Tea and Lemon and Black Currant teas. Both were a new adventure for me, and the Green Tea and Lemon was flavored so delicately and was an enjoyment in the morning that I had to hunt it down once I came back to the US. I found the Twinings USA shop and browsed through their other teas, as I had to have a minimum order of roughly 5 packs of 20 bags of tea each. Deciding to live a little, I purchased two other teas, one of which is the Cranberry and Green Tea. I was most excited to try this one, as I LOVE cranberry...adore it, and consume it in some form every day. Once the packaged arrived, I ripped it open eagerly, boiled water, and plunked in the tea bag, and sniffed anxiously as the aromas wafted. Sweet delicate cranberry and a hint of green tea, just waiting for it to cool down was agony.<br /><br />Once cool enough, I took my first sip and shuddered. It was terrible. Nothing like the smell, nothing like what I had imagined. I figured maybe it was too hot, or maybe the aftertaste of my previous lunch--anything, that could have made it taste awful. So, the following day I braved it again. The taste was just as horrible, there is no taste of cranberry that I can discern. The taste can only be described as boiling water with fresh ashes from an ash tray in a seedy bar, no matter what temperature, water, etc. I tried. Since I purchased a whole box, I force myself to drink a little each week, all the while making faces. Yes, green tea is an acquired taste, and I used to drink it plain with no issue.<br /><br />This, Twinings, was a huge miss for flavored teas. This was very disappointing after my positive experiences with their other teas."

Of my four cans, one was nearly undamaged.  One had cosmetic damage in the form of a dented side.  The other two were dented to the extent of having sharp creases in the bottom and flaws near the seal lines at the top.  I never buy cans like those at the supermarket.<br /><br />COOKING<br /><br />The cooking went much better than I expected.  The evening before, I put 1/4 cup chopped black walnuts, 10 pitted prunes cut into pieces with scissors, and two cups of water into my saucepan.  I brought this mixture to a boil over a simmering-level flame on my propane stove.  I dumped in one-half-cup of McCann's steel cut oats and stirred.  I waited for the mixture to come to a boil again, stirred it a little, turned off the flame, put a lid on the saucepan, and went to bed.  In the morning I was surprised to find that it was perfectly edible with no further cooking.  I did heat it up again on the stove before serving but it stuck to the pot, so I think in the future I will microwave it right in the bowls just before serving it.<br /><br />EATING<br /><br />These oats were good, but it was hard to say if they were ""nuttier"" in flavor than the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats which I had been eating because I cooked them both with nuts.  The texture was of course firmer.  I do like bulgar wheat and these oats are more like that in texture.  Since I was careful not to overcook the rolled oats, there was not much difference in the ""slime"" feel of the two, but the rolled oats were papery much like eating raw oatmeal cookie dough.<br /><br />NUTRITION<br /><br />I found little difference between the nutritional content listed on the McCann steel cut can and that listed on the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats container.  I had to do some Internet research to find the differences which turn out to be subtle but important for certain types of health conditions.  There is also the likelihood of the product simply being fresher due to less processing and better packaging at the mill.<br /><br />REPEAT PURCHASE<br /><br />Now that I have found that the cooking of steel cut oats is much less intimidating than I had imagined, I will probably eat these in preferance to rolled oats in the future.  The possibility of adding them to soups and other cooked entrees in place of barley or bulgar wheat is a bonus.  However, I will probably try a more economical source as I am not convinced that Ireland's soil is superior to that in any other region in which oats are farmed, and metal cans with sharp creases and bent seams don't seem worth the extra cost."

The fruit is freeze dried, for those of you that remember space ice cream, it is the same idea. The fruit is sliced and placed in a machine that freezes the fruit and then a vacuum pulls off the water. The process retains a lot of the original flavor and preserves the fruit for almost eternity (well about two years expiration date on the pouches) without using any chemicals.<br /><br />The taste is really nice. These are all crisp fruit pieces, not the gummy fruit leather food. Banana / Strawberry is probably the tastiest and most fragile. The strawberry flavor is strong and the bananas are subtle without picking up the strawberry flavor. Apples come in a nice second. The pieces are thick and about two inches in diameter. The pears are good, maybe a touch tart and have the same texture as the apples.<br /><br />The fruit is completely dry and absorbs water in your mouth very quickly. If you eat it too fast, the strawberries coat your teeth a little bit. The others are very clean to eat.<br /><br />I like these packages in my carryon bag for plane trips. They make a great emergency snack, take up little space, and weigh nothing. Number two son packs these in his lunch almost every day now. He likes the strawberry banana the best. I really like all three flavors.<br /><br />The pouches list that they are a product of China. I list that as information so you can be aware of where this fruit comes from, and make no value judgment for you. The manufacturing process has been around for a very long time. It is a very safe process, and as long as the fruit going in is good, the food should be good. So far every pouch has been consistently good.<br /><br />I like these a lot. They make a great snack."

The inside kitties are pretty easy to manage. When trying a new variety of food (new to us) I just put that bowl in the kitchen where ""the special eating"" bowls go. Dry food and water are in the kitchen and whatever ""speciality of the evening"" is also located there. No, they do not get a new flavor every night! But one bowl goes there so they always go ""aLookin"" in the kitchen area for their night's extra bowl of wet food! Spoiled???  Yes!!!! Then I know if it is eaten or not. The specialty bowl gets 3 nights of trial...not in a row...to avoid ""nose sticker uppers."" But kitties know a wet bowl is always placed alongside the water and the dry in the kitchen. Water and dry are also located elsewhere, but the kitchen ONLY gets the wet nightly special got trial/accuracy purposes. Nothing is TOO much for the trial and accuracy information for Amazon!<br />It has been 3 weeks now with the Newman Chicken and Brown Rice. There is no question. None of my cats eat it. Not even the birds seem to care for it...or any other animal...as the birds generally eat the dried out left overs and if the bowl is chewed to death, it means a coyote has been by, but I haven't had any coyotes all winter.(Somebody is putting out vittles more to their liking somewhere else, or they have gone further south this winter.<br />So, there, my friends, is how I ended up at this choice of stars for Chicken and Brown Rice Rice Formula Newman's Own.

All the flavors are good but the vanilla creme is an all around winner so if you can only afford to try one flavor this one might be your best bet.  Don't be discouraged by the seemingly high price - one of these little bottles will last a very long time plus you're getting pure high quality ingredients, nothing to damage your health like with sugar and artificial sweeteners.  I find I like stevia better to sweeten cold things than I do hot things.  I personally like about eight drops in a large (8 - 10 oz) tumbler of cold seltzer water that I make using the Isi soda siphon ISI Soda Siphons.  Sometimes I add dry milk powder for a low calorie treat that mocks an ice cream soda.  Sounds odd but it's very good actually.  Now if only Sweetleaf would come out with ginger flavored drops I could make my fav soft drink - ginger ale!!!!"

There are plenty of other brands trying to suggest that they're bold. I've tried the ""Midnight Magic"" brand; I've tried the ""Jet Fuel"" brand; I've tried the ""Donut Shop"" brand; I've tried all of the ""Extra Bolds""; but the K-cup that really tastes like the jet fuel packed cup of coffee that you get in the best donut shop is Emeril's Big Easy Bold.<br /><br />What's really cool is that whether you make a small cup or large cup of Emeril's Big Easy Bold, you won't lose the rich flavor. Most Keurig Coffee Makers have at least two buttons that let you choose to make a large or small cup. Some even have three buttons for a large, medium or small. I like a large cup. Some of the other brands noticeably lost some of their flavor as I went from a medium cup to a large...but not the Emeril's.<br /><br />There is no question here.

I like my energy bars to have no more than 3 grams of fat (or 4 max), while these have 8 (but then again, those lower fat bars don't taste as good as these).  ;-)<br /><br />I would try another flavor of these if there was another good sale and if I could get any that were lower in fat."

I did find it hard to dissolve in cold water. If you have ice in it then it is even harder to dissolve so I recommend water first, add packet, dissolve, then add ice. I found that I only needed half the packet to get the flavor and taste I liked. This is unlike some other drinks where the whole packet in a bottle or container of water is required. It is very sweet and fairly strong. I did not find any bad or bitter taste as can sometimes happen with decaffienated beverages. If it dissolved better it would have had a higher rating.

I've tried the high priced stuff, Royal Kanin, Iams, even Paul Newman's offering which smells better than the stuff I feed myself.  He eats it, of course, but not joyfully, not with that Cocker Spaniel enthusism.  Plainly put, when Stanley eats something he loves, he sends up a spray and every fiber of his doggy being exudes joy.  Yeah, I know, so do I, thanks for bringing it up in front of strangers.  We're talking about the dog, so beat it.<br /><br />Anyway, until now, only people food...but specially prepared for Stanley (vet approved menu: chicken or beef, baked boiled or broiled, fat removed, diced and mooshed together with selected fresh vegetables)...elicited this kind of enthusiasm. I am not averse to cooking for my dog, but it would be nice to be able to open up a can every so often instead. Particularly when there is only one piece of chicken left and I want it.  A friend told me that his finicky dog loved Purina, to the exclusion of all other canned offerings, so I tried it.  Country Stew, Lamb and Rice and this ""Gravy with Beef"" which sounds unappetizing, but smells fine, are his favorites.  He still prefers a nice piece of beef and has absolute and undisputed dibs on the white meat from every chicken, but this rates a ten on his tail-wagging unbridled joy of eating scale.<br /><br />I should point out that Stanley also eats bugs when he can get them, so while the word ""choosy"" might describe his eating habits, so does disgusting.  But no matter, he's the best Good Boy ever and deserves the best...whether it's people food, dog food or the occasional crawly thing."

Unfortunately, a lot of the ""gourmet"" coffee brands (Starbucks, Green Mountain) have partnered with the more upscale single-serve machines (Tassimo, etc.), so I was excited when I found these. I've been very pleased with them so far. As reviewers have noted about other WP roasts, the pods are packed very full and are a bit thicker than Senseo pods. I have found that 1 WP pod fits snugly but fine in Senseo's single-pod holder, but 2 WP pods do not fit in the double holder - although that is not a problem for me as I rarely brew 2 pods at once. I was happy to find that brewing 1 pod on the large setting produces a reasonably flavorful cup compared to some of the other brands, which only taste good on the small setting. I would definitely buy these again, and I look forward to trying some of the other WP roasts."

Being able to brew one high-quality cup of coffee is indeed one of life's little luxuries.<br /><br />Like other single-serving, prepackaged food technologies, however, Keurig k-cup coffee tends toward the expensive when compared to whole bean or tinned ground coffee.

By having the coffee delivered at regular intervals (with free shipping!) the cost is reduced considerably.<br /><br />But which coffees to buy? I selected Jet Fuel partly, I confess, because the name is so darned cute. The (relatively) non-wasteful packaging also was an attraction, though let's face it, there is plenty of plastic residue associated with this brewing technology. The Coffee People at least minimize the waste, however, and for this I salute them.<br /><br />What about the coffee itself? Jet Fuel is a dark, rich, full-bodied coffee that to me is reminiscent of the ""industrial strength"" coffee I can get at Peet's, my favorite west coast coffee purveyor/establishment. In other words, it's amazingly delicious.  The Keurig system allows you to select the strength you want.<br /><br />Overall, Jet Fuel is a winner for fans of robust coffee. Bon appetit!"

The bag contains 5 servings and the fat content is 1 gm per serving.  I was really surprised by the negative reviews for the product.  Sadly, our taste buds have deceived us into preferring what is unhealthy and harmful to us.  Neither Twizzlers nor Vines products contain licorice extract.  Instead those companies ""value"" their consumers by depriving them of the healing properties of the licorice herb and replacing it with what is artificial and known to be dangerous to our health. It is even MORE unfortunate that some consumers are so highly committed to the products of those companies that are not committed to THEM or the use of quality ingredients."

They are doing a lot of things right.  The coffee is fair trade and organic certified, roasted in small batches, and the company has started a non-profit organization ""kicks for a cause,"" a group which engages children in soccer to contribute to a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I do not really go for using the name of someone who is unable to choose whether or not they would endorse the product, but that said, their hearts and conscience seem to be in the right place.  The coffee, however (in my opinion) is not very good.  I am saying this as a huge fan of African coffees (my personal favorite) and as one who goes well out of her way to procure same (since it is scarce in the Hawaiian islands, and expensive to bring in).  I have reviewed several other yirgacheffes which I have purchased here.  I would say that this particular brand is among the worst: bitter and completely lacking in the distinctive notes for which yirgacheffe is known.  Among the coffees I have reviewed on Amazon, I would say that the Coffee Masters roast <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6O5W0"">Coffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a> is the best, followed by equal exchange <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5UJW"">Equal Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> and then Marley and Coffee Bean direct. (None as good as Green Mountain, Trader Joes, or several small roasters).<br />It is too bad.  I would like to see companies like this one become successful, as they are doing a lot of good things in the world and their community.  but, in all honesty, this particular coffee is not very good."

Nothing personal - just stating the fact. This particular buckwheat is simple and wholesome natural grain that needs to be flavored with other things like fenugreek seed or spices. I also tried to grow it and it does sprout in about 48 hours. It is superb natural product. It can be cooked in the matter of 15 minutes and then eaten with meat and gravy of choice or with milk and honey as cereal in the morning. This is ""going to the basics"" type of food.

I adopted a shelter kitten two years ago, and did tons of research into the best litter and food. The vet experts shied away from Feline Pine because of the strong scent (said cats don't like it). So I went with clumping clay litter. Anyone who has used clay knows all about the dust and tracking issues, especially if you live in a small apartment, which I do. After getting tired of coats of litter dust everywhere (including on my cats - who not only inhale but ingest the dust when they groom themselves) plus the unending battle of tiny pieces strewn everywhere, I switched to Feline Pine. It has made all the difference in the world. I am completely happy with this product. True, they did not like it at first; it is a radical change. But after two months they have adjusted and are fine with it. No more dust, no more dust on the cats, no tiny pieces everywhere. Lasts a long time and practically no odor. (I clean the box twice a day.) Usage tips: Definitely buy the wide-slotted scoop, a minimal cost. Otherwise you'll throw out too many clean pellets. The pellets disintegrate when wet and I scoop that out too. It does require a different technique. The makers say to just shake the box so the wet stuff falls to the bottom. I say yuck, why leave used, wet litter in the box. So I take the wet stuff in the new scoop and filter it through the old scoop, which leaves the dry pellets behind. Takes longer but totally worth it. Keeps it cleaner. Highly, highly recommended, especially if space is an issue."

The ingredients are hibiscus flowers, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, raspberry flavor, licorice powder and citric acid.  For some reason, the ingredients also list soy.<br /><br />The taste is crisp and refreshing, even iced and without any sweetener.  A small amount of sugar, stevia (such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ"">Stevita Supreme - 50pkts - 1.8 oz / Packet</a>) or other sweetener is all you need to satisfy a sweet craving.<br /><br />To make great iced tea, bring water (filtered according to your preferences) to a boil, then let cool until bubbles are no longer forming.  Slowly pour the water into a heat-tolerant pitcher (I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013Z9NY0"">Luminarc Quadro 2-Liter Glass Pitcher with Lid</a> -- get two, one for the fridge and one for the next batch!) and steep 4 teabags for 3 to 5 minutes, then let cool and place in the refrigerator.<br /><br />One box of 20 bags will make 10 liters of iced tea -- that's a huge savings compared to bottled beverages, which are about 10 times the cost.  The bags and the box can go in the compost, making this option superior to bottled beverages (really just another form of bottled water).  Bottled beverages also require much more fossil fuel use to transport from the bottler to the store.<br /><br />I do wish that Stash would market a licorice-free version.  A recent study showed that 1 daily serving of hibiscus tea can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 7 mm of mercury.  This may be helpful for those with hypertension.  Licorice, on the other hand, is a potent raiser of blood pressure.<br /><br />With your Amazon Prime membership, and Amazon's convenient subscription plan, Stash Premium Wild Raspberry Hibiscus tea can be shipped at customizable intervals to you for further savings."

A 5 lb Havahart Critter Ridder is not available in my area, only the 3 lb one and it isn't even sufficient! But let me tell you this ...

I am so tird of having to buy 2 or 3 - 3 lbs if they are available (and it hasn't been for awhile) just one for the front and one for the back yard!<br /><br />THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE TROPIC ZONE AREAS: (By reason of frequent Thunderstorms / Rains)<br /><br />* Wear your lawn or work gloves, sprinkle up in front (I learned this the hard way) in a scattered motion in areas in the front. Areas you know where stray dogs and dog walkers (especially owners who do not pick up after their dog's business) you know that the dog does his/her business, you will sprinkle a little more than usual without dumping the whole entire bottle.<br /><br />* Garbage Can areas - where Coyotes to Wolves and even Foxes and Monkeys raid into them - sprinkle behind the location is sufficient especially helpful if it is in a covered area and lightly in the front (usually where it is going to get wet anyway and the need to re-sprinkle it later). If you have your wife's panty hose that has a hole in it, use the good area, tie a knot on one end and a knot on the other after sprinkling some Havahart Critter Ridder inside. (If you don't have a wife, you can often find them in thrift stores or buy some on Amazon) On the lid inside,  one end and using a fishing line and poking a hole (depending on what type of garbage can lid you might have; or you might have to drill a tiny hole first ... then thread it with a fishing line to two ends. Now you can safely attach the Havahart Critter Ridder inside of your lid of your garbage can which will definitely will can those creatures that opens it for good! (Replinishing it will not be difficult at all)<br /><br />* Veggies to Fruit Trees - be very careful of how much you sprinkle around them for some of the chemicals you place for the plant (fertilizer to feed) contains some repellants themselves. I had found a more effective way to get rid of them due to frequent rains was the same method to get rid of slugs (beer on a lid) - so SAVE THAT CAP to even sardine tin cans. Placing them around after putting Havahart Critter Ridder sprinkles in the clean lid to tin can; the smell itself will drive them away.

This Havahart<br />  really is effective on them<br /> - Florida Panthers and Hybrids - no effect, when they are hungry,<br />  they are going to raid your garbage can anyway but very quick at<br />  it, take what they want and run off with it.<br /> - Bobcats - while rare here, they do appear once in a blue moon and<br />  behaves just like the Florida Panther and the Hybrids.<br /> - Peacocks / Peahens / Peachicks - just cannot stand it (Havahart)<br />  and are the only birds that are sensitive to it that which I love<br />  so much but one has to give or take - because these birds are just<br />  as destructive as other rodents, critters, and animals.<br />SPECIAL NOTE:<br /> - WILL NOT WORK ON RABIED ANIMAL OF ANY SORT - IF YOU SEE ONE, CALL<br />  IMMEDIATELY PER YOUR COUNTY'S ORDINANCE OR 911 SO THEY CAN CAPTURE<br />  SUCH SAID ANIMAL OR CRITTER.

However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.<br /><br />Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.<br /><br />I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone<br />BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is ""sweet"" BBQ. Everyone else loved them.<br />Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ<br />Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags)<br />Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more<br />Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter.<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag<br /><br />I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account."

I don't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants.  This is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work!

Give it about 10-20 mins to kick in.  Seems to last for 3-4 hrs.  No side affects that I can tell.  So glad to be rid of the racing heart side affect and dry mouth/ sore throat that comes with sudafed.  It works great paired with a sinus rinse or netty pot.

My machine goes back up on the closet shelf for another year... the concept is awesome, the machine is neat, but when the drinks taste like burned coffee beans, I just won't use it.<br /><br />I'm not giving up on you yet, Tassimo... but the K-Cups at work sure do taste a lot better than the stuff coming out of the Tassimo..."

Long distance, high intensity sports need calories, salts and proteins. Weekenders rarely need calories and salts, unless they live in a high humidity area and sweat considerably.  Salts should include potassium, calcium but little sodium.  Sugars in the form of glucose or sucrose should be added but not to excess.  Stay away from corn syrups and corn additives. Having said all that, most drinks that are low in sodium salts, and neutral on calories (sugars/proteins) will provide enough nutritive additions to you while you exercise.  Keep in mind that one of the reasons you exercise is to loose weight.  If you add a bunch of calories while your exercising, your weight loss will be for naught. Stay away from sugar bars and  caffeine unless your a long distance runner and or cyclist. This CytoSport drink is a good choice for the average sportive  who does not need to supplement their diet on a routine basis.  It is also good for the high intensity sportive when they also supplement their diets with high energy food while they exercise."

This would be helpful information to have as we are storing these for use with canned chicken and tuna for emergency food storage. There is only a production date, so I will have to use my own judgement on how long mayo is likely good after being produced!"

If you haven't had good proscuitto, then there isn't really anything to compare the Jamon product to.  The chopped stuff at your everyday grocery store is good for a little salty proscuitto like flavor in dishes but not for slices just to enjoy.<br /><br />I understand why people think Jamon is awesome, but the melting in your mouth with extreme grease/fat over your lips and fingers really sets home the fat content more than that Kobe Beef flavor burst and easier swallow.<br /><br />In the high end Jamon, you can really taste the acorns in the meat.  The nuttiness really comes through and it is very good.  The Iberico Paleta -> you don't get the nuttiness and it's a little tougher.  The Serrano really has much more meat and I preferred the flavor profile on it more than the other two.<br /><br />While I would rate the Iberico Bellato around 4 out of 5 stars (minus 1 for the heavy greasy feeling and fat), the price is ridiculous.  I would say it would be appropriately priced around $15-25/pound.  Given that is 4-6x lower than it's actual price, I had to take at least 2 stars from the product.<br /><br />You're better off with the SM Proscuitto.

These points alone encourage me to consider this product over dominate corporate graham cracker manufactures that has lost their way.<br /><br />Each individual box contains three packets of graham crackers containing 7 crackers each (21 total crackers per box).  Oddly enough, I couldn't find any mention of this on the packaging.<br /><br />The taste I find just average and bit on the dry side.  Make sure you have something to wash them down with, but that's true of most graham crackers.  I'm not sure what they could do to make it taste better as I've never made graham crackers myself.  The added oats are a nice touch but since they are sprinkled on the top they often fall off as you pull them out of the packaging.  I wonder why they didn't just mix the oats in the batter?  I've also tried the apple cinnamon flavor and would rate the taste a bit more satisfying than the honey flavor.<br /><br />All in all, I do recommend these crackers despite the 3/5 rating but namely for the healthier ingredients.  And for the record, I do not think I've ever had a 5/5 graham cracker.  :)<br /><br />PROS<br />====<br />+ Healthy core ingredients compared to many competitors.  For example, normal sugar instead of corn syrup and sea salt (extra minerals) instead of standard salt<br />+ No artificial colors or preservatives<br />+ Pro environment packaging<br /><br />CONS<br />====<br />- Vast majority of crackers broken<br />- Oats easily fall off crackers<br />- Taste is average (also a tad dry and slightly rough on the mouth compared Nabisco)<br />- Inconsistent or inadequate perforations making it hard to break crackers in half or fourths"

They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.  This would be a great addition to a sandwich for lunch, or an in-between meal snack.  I am happy to add Popchips to my snack rotation."

I. personally, do not eat it, but none of my 6 kitties,including 2 ferals (last time I wrote, I had only one feral, but now have two and neither feral will eat this. They may be wild and not let a human close to them, but they know their cat food tastes. Two stars means ""I don't like it, and since I am the one doing the buying, I figure it is OK if I state that that ""I don'tlike it"" because I do not like buying something that the 6 cats that I feed will not eat it. I feed the ferals outside the back door and I can watch them ""eat or not eat"" by watching through the window. My kitties always announce the arrival of the ferals by jumping up and down at the window when my regular ""orange and white kitty"" and my ""sometimes I deign to eat here 'black and white Kitty'"" arrive for dinner! My, My, What an exciting life I have!!!...The high point of my evening being watching the ferals eat and then writing a review of their eating habits up on Amazon!<br />Anyway, I have made it clear as to how I keep tabs of the ferals and their eating habits. The inside kitties are pretty easy to manage. When trying a new variety of food (new to us) I just put that bowl in the kitchen where ""the special eating"" bowls go. Dry food and water are in the kitchen and whatever ""speciality of the evening"" is also located there. No, they do not get a new flavor every night! But one bowl goes there so they always go ""aLookin"" in the kitchen area for their night's extra bowl of wet food! Spoiled???  Yes!!!! Then I know if it is eaten or not. The specialty bowl gets 3 nights of trial...not in a row...to avoid ""nose sticker uppers."" But kitties know a wet bowl is always placed alongside the water and the dry in the kitchen. Water and dry are also located elsewhere, but the kitchen ONLY gets the wet nightly special got trial/accuracy purposes. Nothing is TOO much for the trial and accuracy information for Amazon!<br />It has been 3 weeks now with the Newman Chicken and Brown Rice. There is no question. None of my cats eat it. Not even the birds seem to care for it...or any other animal...as the birds generally eat the dried out left overs and if the bowl is chewed to death, it means a coyote has been by, but I haven't had any coyotes all winter.(Somebody is putting out vittles more to their liking somewhere else, or they have gone further south this winter.<br />So, there, my friends, is how I ended up at this choice of stars for Chicken and Brown Rice Rice Formula Newman's Own. Oddly enough, everyone likes the beef and brown rice:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BXT278"">Newman's Own Organics Adult Variety Pack Canned Cat Food</a>, but that is a whole ""nother"" story for a different time.<br />Sorry that we have a disappointing story to tell: Gabby, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, Orange and White Kitty and Black and White Kitty...as told to and documented by ""Cindy O"". Bye for now on the cat food trail tale until we ""come upon"" something else good ole mom thinks should be tried."

In the past I have regularly used Nutrasweet.  I have tried Stevia but I found that I did not like its aftertaste.  I never warmed to saccharine because of its bad aftertaste, too.  I have used Splenda blends in baking with good results as well, though I seldom bake any sweets any more due to dietary reasons.<br /><br />What I liked about Nectresse was that it didn't seem to add any flavor to my yogurt beyond sweetness.  I detected no aftertaste at all, and the sweetness itself was fairly mild.  By comparison, the same amount of Splenda (one packet per 8 ounces of yogurt) has a higher level of sweetness.<br /><br />Just to confirm my perceptions, I decided to taste both Nectresse and Splenda by themselves.  In this taste test, I again found Nectresse to have a slightly lower level of sweetness.  Nectresse looks a bit more like sugar -- small grains versus fine white powder.  Beyond the different appearance and slightly different intensity level, the products were nearly identical in that they both taste clean with a hint of an aftertaste that is apparent when consumed alone but is masked when used as they normally would be -- mixed with other ingredients.<br /><br />I'll leave it to others to debate how natural this product is.  In addition to the hyped monk fruit extract, it also contains erythritol, sugar, and molasses.  In fact, erythritol is the first ingredient listed, so I assume that means that the product, by weight, contains more of that than the other ingredients.  According to what I read online, erythritol is much less likely to cause intestinal discomfort than other sugar alcohols because it is largely absorbed in the small intestine.  I've never been bothered by any sugar alcohol in this regard, however, except on the lone unfortunate occasion when I consumed WAY too much sugar-free chocolate and had a regretful afternoon."

Well, I happen to like more than a hint of sweetness in my bowl of cereal, so I had to figure out how to approach this cereal. Looking at the marketing on the box, I tried to pretend I was someone who actually cared enough about their health to appreciate the lack of sweetness in their brand of cereal. When I did, this cereal immediately came across as tasty and healthy. There is a hint of brown sugar, but nothing more. Just enough to keep you from wanting to ask someone else for a packet of sugar if you were eating it at work, for example. I happen to be eating it at home, so once I tried it without sugar, I put my daily dose of sugar back in there, so I could judge the taste of the actual product both ways. I think both the health nut and the sugar-adventurous type will appreciate the taste of this cereal. My rating takes my bias in favor of sugar into account, and judges the actual product by how I would take it in my natural environment. Especially since the user can always add a sweetener later, but you can't add taste so easily.<br /><br />If you're kids are already 'trained' to eat healthy, they could theoretically munch on these as a snack-in addition to having them with milk-without complaining. If you're kids are the 'frosted flakes' type, then they may glance you a 'why are you doing this to me?' look. They'll be getting their whole grains, a good amount of protein (6g/cup)and fiber (5g/cup). If you glanced a 'this is all we have, so take it or leave it' look, then I think they'd continue to munch on it, but not without giving that 'fine...but I'm not thrilled about this, just so you know' pouty-face look.<br /><br />On the front, it says the cereal has 1 gram per serving of soluble fiber and that 3 grams of soluble fiber from oatmeal daily in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease, but in the nutritional facts section, it states the product as having 2 grams of soluble fiber (with a total fiber content of 5 grams). I guess if you were looking out for that kind of thing, you might take the lowest figure of 1 gram per serving, to be safe.<br /><br />In sum, it's pretty good-tasting and healthy,too."

After moving down south, I discovered what REAL ice tea is.  Over the years, making iced tea at home, I had tried the big-name teas - Lipton, Luzianne, Tetley, etc. - and thought they were okay, but I could never quite make the tea strong enough no matter how long I left the teabags to steep.  Then I came across Red Rose at the grocery store one day and thought I'd give it a try.  Wow, was I blown away at how much better it was.  Huge tea flavor from the same amount of teabags - that astringent tannin taste was so much more that I now think other brands must somehow either use poorer quality tea leaves or screw something up in their processing.<br /><br />But then, wouldn't you know, my grocery store stopped carrying Red Rose tea, so I started ordering it online directly from the company a few years ago.  I have had only one issue with one box (it had 21 instead of 22 and I just wanted to let them know for q.a. purposes - no big deal) and they promptly sent me a whole new box.  That's real customer service!  A company that cares if you like them or not, even if the issue was such a trifle! Finally, I found you can order it here at Amazon, albeit by the case, but that saves on shipping costs vs. ordering thru Redco Foods directly (where you can order individual boxes if you want to try it out).  And at $3/box it is a terrific price and value for the superior quality received.<br /><br />So, if you would like a stronger tea flavor from your ice tea, then Red Rose is the brand you've been looking for."

(1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars); (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product (3-4 stars); and (3) ""price is no object"" foods that make no compromises (5-6 stars).  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog food anywhere.  Period.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with the highest quality ingredients you'll ever find in dog food.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food there is.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product:  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK"">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for ""hill's science diet dry dog food.""  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6"">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot."

Some Internet research uncovered that it is blended for Harrod's by Williamson, so I tracked down their Earl Grey which was then avaliable on two US websites.  It is even better than Harrod's.  Harrod's Earl Grey, by the way, is best purchased as you leave the UK.  There is a Harrod's store in the international departure area at Heathrow - they do not charge the 18% VAT.  Willaimson reorganized last year and their tea was supposedly unavailable in the US, so its appearance on Amazon - and with Amazon Prime elegibility - is more than welcome.  This is the finest.<br />Another fact: Williamson is reputed to blend the tea for the Royal Family in Britain.<br />Some added thoughts: I did a little research on the Williamson website.  They now grow their tea on their own farms in the hioghlands of Kenya.  Undoubtedly the superior flavor of the tea comes from the quality of the base tea.  They mention picking only the bud and first two leaves.  That cannot be beat.  Some teas are the first three; Argentine tea (known for being some ofthe world's worst) is ""harvested"" with a machine that looks like a hedge trimmer.  Any leaves past the first three have no tea flavor.  So excellent harvesting is a laborious hand process."

It's found in the Indian and Western Pacific Oceans.<br /><br />Over 90 percent of tongol tuna in the market comes from four nations: Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia and Thailand. All have numerous management measures in place to help protect tongol tuna populations; however, Malaysia is the only one that also has adequate enforcement. For this reason, tongol tuna from Malaysia is ranked as a ""Good Alternative.""<br /><br />Tongol tuna is caught in a variety of ways. Gear such as trolls, handlines, or pole gear is more selective, and tongol tuna caught these ways are ""Good Alternatives.""<br /><br />Tongol tuna caught using all other gear (including gillnets and purse seines) has high bycatch of sharks and juvenile fishes and is ranked as ""Avoid"" - unless caught in Malaysia, in which case it's a ""Good Alternative."""

He did great on it for all that time.  Great coat, firm stool, easy to maintain weight, and great blood tests at his yearly check-ups.  We were extremely active, with daily runs and walks, play at the park, etc. But digestibility was always a bit on the low side. If I cut the volume of food down, he would loose weight before any noticeable decrease in stool size.<br />I could also use the kibble for training, as he really liked the flavor.<br /><br />My Girl Friend's Rottie is on a mix of this with Canidae All Life Stages.  She is a high drive, work-aholic! Honest, you would be hard pressed to find a more active dog.  She does amazingly well on this.  Stunningly beautiful coat, great digestibility, easily maintained weight.  She has been on this mix for about 2 years now, and she is seven.  No kidney issues with high protein, but we will watch as she ages. Her focus, and attention seems more rock solid too on this mix...<br /><br />At Super-Mutts yearly check-up (when he was 10-1/2) we noticed kidney functions were out of whack.  So as a test I switched him to a senior food (Chicken Soup for the Soul), this is much lower protein.  This change brought his kidney functions back to normal, and digestibility is better.

Our dog, who gets lots of small, bite-size treats as part of his continuing training, gets tired of diced sausage-shaped moist food from the pet store and cut-up franks from the grocery, but he'll run a mile for a liver treat! I do wish they were smaller and/or less expensive. We usually cut them in quarters with a sharp knife to make them last longer."

With little effort I grow a wide variety of delicious and fresh sprouts in my kitchen. The trays stack up nicely and I have six of them, one on top of the other. They require little space. Believe it or not, it's like having a small farm in the house that produces an impressive amount and array of ""fresh vegatables"", albeit in sprout form. The sprouts grown in these trays stay fresh and never develop an unpleasant smell. They taste crisp, are pleasant to eat and have become the mainstay in my daily intake of vegetables in my diet. I clean my trays outside with a spray nozzle attached to my garden hose. This makes cleaning quick and easy, then I rinse them in the sink with some bleach in the water to sterilize them before growing a fresh crop. The trays are foolproof and have changed the way I eat. With the price of vegetables rising in the supermarkets, I've found these trays to be a great money saver - to say nothing of the superior nutrition that eating sprouts provide. I would highly recommend them to anyone!<br /> - Chris Morton"

I initially bought it only to make pancakes and I was pleased at how they tasted (though flat.  I think I will try the seltzer water as mentioned). I'd been craving chocolate chip cookies like mad and made some with another gluten-free flour brand and the cookies were dry and the required xantham gum all by itself costs $10 for a flat package smaller than my hand.  I refused to spend lots of money every time I wanted to make cookies, then one day I decided to make Pamela's recipe on the package.  These are by far the best chocolate cookies I've ever had in my life!<br /><br />I've also eaten her store-bought chocolate chip cookies. It's $4 for 9 cookies.  The packaged cookies are good, but the homemade cookies made with her flour tastes way better.<br /><br />Now that I can order this flour in bulk, I will start experimenting with other recipes using this flour. It's too expensive to use the small bags ($6-$7 for 16 oz.) if you plan to do a lot of baking. I had been buying the gluten-free rice bread but for $6 per tiny loaf, and it's just awful.  My mom gave me a bread machine and I'm looking forward to making my own breads with Pamela's flours.<br /><br />To anyone who is gluten-intolerant and pondering if they should purchase Pamela's products, don't ponder anymore!

Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.  If a store offered this flavor in the past and no longer carries it... sad to say for the people who love this flavor... perhaps it didn't sell well.  It probably didn't appeal to the masses as the sensation and flavor is... unique.<br /><br />I was very interested in trying this flavor as I really like licorice and I love tea.  Upon taking my first sip, I thought the licorice flavor came through nice and the combination of spices was fine.  But then... seconds after my first sip, I got this really weird sensation on the sides of my tongue.  As if the flavor ""blossomed"" in my mouth.  And, to me, not in a pleasant way.  Another reviewer said the tea ""dances around the sides of your tongue.""  It does.  What's up with that?  That reviewer seemed to like the sensation.  I didn't like it at all.  It felt weird, it tasted weird and is making me cringe every time I take a sip.  I like the initial flavor, but I know the ""flavor burst"", or whatever you want to call it, is coming and it ruins the whole relaxing tea experience for me.  This is definitely not relaxing.<br /><br />The ""flavor burst"" is also followed by a sickly sweet after taste.  Ick.<br /><br />Most reviewers here love this tea, which I think is nice because I really wanted to like it too.  I'm surprised more people did not mention this unusual flavor thing going on.  Maybe it's an acquired taste sensation and I'm just not there yet.  So, buyer beware before stocking up on this flavor.  Definitely test it first if you can.  If anything, test it so you can see for yourself what I am talking about.  At least it's interesting... in a strange sort of way.  It's definitely not a tea I can drink regularly.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient list:  (contains NO true tea leaves)<br />Licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, Chinese star anise, vanilla flavor, sarsaparilla, orange oil, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil."

The product is a spice/ oil mix that is to be wisked with water until it is smooth.  This never turned into a smooth paste for us; it did not dissolve in the water and pressing the product against the sides of the bowl was the only way for it to eventually mix with the water.

Unfortunately the flavor is definitely not equivalent to very good milk or dark chocolate (ie Godiva, Dove etc). It nice that there is something available for those who can't eat regular chocolate. I bought the 5 pack from Chocoperfection website ($21 for 5 bars, free shipping). It came quickly, well packaged, fresh, not melted, good communication via email. Unfortunately the milk chocolate flavor is reminiscent of cheap ""chocolate"" (think inexpensive chocolate flavored Easter bunnies or dollar store ""chocolate""). Someone in another review had mentioned this, and I do agree. Cheap chocolate flavor is not necessarily a bad thing. My husband likes that flavor. Keep in mind my perspective is from someone who typically eats the real deal, your mileage may vary especially if you haven't had the real deal in a while. The raspberry dark chocolate flavor and mint dark (received a mini sample of that one) tastes better than the milk and plain dark in my opinion.<br />There is also a product called ""DeMets sugar free turtles"", available in Walgreens and Walmart, $2.00 a bag. They are also made with Erythritol (like Chocoperfection) instead of the usual suspects of malitol (that's in the Russelstover sugar free stuff) that cause GI issues. Can't tell there is no sugar in the Demets and no upset."

My family and I enjoy most Taco Bell products; both from the restaurant and the in-store products.  I love their Fire Sauce, and wish they sold it in bottle form at the grocery store.  So when I saw this new Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce, I was excited to try it.  I really enjoy just about anything spicy, so my hopes and expectations were high.  Now that I have tried this sauce, I am somewhat disappointed yet find it to be a good addition to most Mexican foods that I enjoy.<br /><br />The name of the product clearly states ""Bold & Creamy.""  I agree with the creamy aspect of their claim, but feel that the word bold should be changed to something less aggressive, like tangy.  You definitely detect notes of Jalapeno peppers in the sauce, but it is quite subdued and has a somewhat artificial taste.  But I'm not bashing the product or saying that it isn't tasty.  I have found my favorite use of this product is with tacos and burritos.  I add a light amount of the Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce to my soft and hard shell tacos, and then add generous amounts of Taco Bell Fire Sauce (I hoard packets of that stuff and always try to get as much of it as I can whenever I visit the Taco Bell drive-thru).  The Jalapeno sauce gives the tacos a bit of a sour cream flavor, while also added just a slight bit of Jalapeno kick.  I have tried this sauce with several other things from sandwiches to salads, and even a spicy chicken wrap.  While I didn't mind the sauce with the wrap, I didn't enjoy it at all with sandwiches and salads.<br /><br />Overall I will likely continue to purchase this product going forward, but I think a single bottle will last quite some time.  It doesn't have a good enough taste to stand on its own, as a dip or as a replacement for other sauces that I enjoy.  I don't find it to be nearly spicy enough, but I also understand that making it much more spicy would likely limit their sales to a more specific consumer market.  It is an above average product that is a solid compliment to some Mexican dishes, but I don't see this becoming a best seller among the Taco Bell brand name.  But I don't think the product is the type that most people will either love or hate.  It falls right in the middle, and I think most people will find it to be moderately satisfactory.  Go ahead and give it a try for yourself.  I suggest picking up a single bottle before buying a lot of 6, as they sell on this site, just to make sure you enjoy it enough to consider stocking up with that quantity.  I hope you enjoy it.  =o)"

I was happy to try Mio Liquid Peach Tea and Mio Peach/Mango Tea to see if it would be better than real peach tea or other peach tea brands. The idea is simple, make a syrup to add to your glass for some delicious tea wherever you are. No messy packets to mess with; No clouds of powder to smell. However, getting it to the right flavor took a lot of shots. The directions say one shot per each 8oz of water. I filled two glasses with 8oz of water. This review deals only with the peach.<br />On the first shot, you could get a hint of something but it definitely wasn't a peach flavor. The second shot smelled like peach but tasted like chlorinated water. The third shot had a wee bit of peach flavor and smelled stronger, but definitely not something you'd want to sit down and sip. The fourth and final shot got a more clear taste of peach but still not strong enough for my liking or my husband's. By the fourth shot and taste test, I decided it wasn't worth trying to add more to get a better flavor. Since each pack is enough liquid for 24 8oz servings (as stated on the packaging), I would say the actual number of glasses of tea you'd get from this using 4 shots each is 6 glasses - 24ozs. A whole lot less than 24 glasses."

These treats last twice as long as the PETCO and PETSMART chews and they are less than half the cost.  The only thing is the high shipping cost.  All in all I am very pleased with this product and would recommend them.

I can't seem to find these in stock at any nearby stores, which is fine since you automatically get super saver shipping on these, but beware that the price will skyrocket when they're backordered (these things are like liquid gold). I can't start my morning without these anymore and insist on dragging them with me on vacations and trips. Beware the vanilla flavor though, which I hated so much that I threw them away (no one would take them off my hands). They were lumpy and left a gross after taste.

Before this she was not able to successfully lose the weight.<br /><br />Nutiva Organic extra virgin (actually in the field of coconut oil there is no distinction between virgin and extra virgin like the grades of olive oil)is the best coconut oil brand for quality due to its true essence of coconut flavor. This is one of the very few companies that keep with the tradition of producing it cold pressed by hand which allows the oil to maintain all of its nutritional benefits.  It's not an over powering oil.  It has a clean, tropical, nutty scent and delicate flavor.<br /><br />It is good for baking, sauteeing, frying, for smoothies, spreadable on bread/pancakes, great for creating frosting, and making dipping chocolate or added with chocolate for fondue, taken orally for weight loss, lip gloss, hot oil treatment for hair, hair dress, massage oil, skin moisturizer, nail/cuticle conditioner, make up remover,  a combatant for vaginal/infections due to coconut's antiviral properties, used to moisten the inner nasal membrane to protect against dryness, and great (especially when combined with olive oil)for making bars of soap.<br /><br />Coconut oil is extremely beneficial for your health because it has both short and medium chain fatty acids which promotes weight loss, increased metabolism, and healthy skin.  Many experience the lowering of bad cholestorol while consuming.<br /><br />It is the secret ingredient I use for sauteeing broccoli and cauliflower with a hint of ginger and nutmeg.  I use it for salmon, lamb, chicken, eggs (yum), and it brings out such a dimension to food.  I prefer it to butter and olive oil in cooking when I have it on hand. My cakes, brownies, quick breads turn out moister with coconut oil and rise better. Because it liquifies beyond 72degress F it may be necessary to combine coconut oil with a heavier fat (such as butter) when baking cookies.<br /><br />Due to it's properties, coconut oil absorbs nicely into one's hair to soften it and combat frizziness.  After trying other brands of coconut oil, none has compared to the remarkable pureness and flavor of Nutiva."

Kraft has a very good and reliable name, and their macaroni and cheese dinner is a good product, and we still expect the best quality from them.... but Kraft has maintained the same standard in this product over the years while their smaller competitors have been changing for the better!<br /><br />Because ""Kraft dinner"" got a little pricey over the past few years, (around a dollar a box nowadays, depending on where you buy it), I finally relented and tried an ""off brand"". I picked up a few boxes  of ""Our Specialty"" brand at the local Dollar General store (total size = 7.25 ounce box. serving size, 2.5 oz. ""Prepared"" stats: 400 calories, 150 calories from fat, RDA sodium = 30%; 1% cholesterol; 17% total carbs) -- it was 33 cents per box and it simply tastes MUCH better than Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Dinner. Also, the macaroni in the Our Specialty brand holds up better -- it's very tender but it doesn't go flat when you boil it like the Kraft does.<br /><br />A good friend of mine recently re-confirmed my own findings when he said that he bought the brand which is sold at Meier's Stores (a big food chain) around Cincinnati, Ohio, and he experienced the very same results with their store brand.<br /><br />So, maybe it's time that we took a look at more ""off brands,"" clones, and generics. There are some really good smaller companies out there selling some very high-quality food products so don't be afraid to try them, especially when there is such a huge price difference!<br /><br />I hope that you find this review/recommendation helpful."

Surprisingly she took to the taste of the Wellness Small Breed Weight Control kibble almost immediately. I didn't even need to ween her off of the Wellness original kibble, just gave her the weight control formula and she liked it, no problems with her digestion. The color of the kibble is slightly less brown than the original adult formula, but she did not seem to notice a difference at all. She likes the small size of the kibble, and recently I have noticed that she has lost about 4 ounces... not much but it is a start. Hopefully with exercise and some restraint by me, she will be within her normal weight range, but I am happy I made the switch and will continue to purchase this brand.<br />TIP: My dog is a picky eater, so I sometimes mix a bit of water into the food which causes the food to give off an aroma, which draws her to it. It also makes it easier for her to eat because it softens the kibble. It's also good because it keeps her hydrated... Just an FYI."

As a final note the bags were much smaller than I expected because I considered how large 40 ounces of oatmeal would be but I guess the addition of the dried fruit and nuts adds weight, so the package is slightly less than half of a 40 ounce can of oatmeal."

Maybe it's the only oil available in bulk that do not put off people with the smell.<br /><br />Update: It's the same thing when my other oils arrived.  They are dense.  Since their bottles are almost unbreakable, they packaging is normally just big air bubbles loosely around them.  They experience violence forces during transit.  The bottles have a pretty normal secure seal like any normal products in the supermarket.  But their seal broke during individual transit.  That explains the slight leaks.  When fall comes, the oil turn into a beautiful solid.<br /><br />Now I understand what is a light oil.  Coconut oil is not.  You can't apply it to your hair without using a normal shampoo to remove the greasy feeling.  The strong greasy feeling that you cannot stand going to bed with it in your dry hair.  You may want a thick oil for the skin though.  You got instant soft skin even for hardened sole.

The dogs go nuts every time I reach for that box.  I think they enjoy the variety because after I give them their treat they still look at me like ""what else is she gonna give us"" and sometimes I swear it's more like ""but mom, I don't like that kind, I want the other one"".<br /><br />I mix all kinds of mainly dental treats together in the box.  Rawhide sticks (all colors and flavors, not just green ones), Greenies, Dingos, CET and also use some rawhide bones.  These treats help scrape plaque from their teeth while chewing before tarter can form if given after meals or once a day.  My dogs do not get soft food or treats unless we are training.  Saving soft treats for training makes them want it all the more and the hard food is better for their teeth and digestion.<br /><br />I have a Miniature Pinscher and 2 Pomeranians that are prone to tooth loss so taking care of their teeth is very important to me.  My oldest Pomeranian is 6 years old and just had his first professional cleaning and that was mainly because it is hard for me to get his back teeth because his mouth is so tiny.<br /><br />They love when they see the bag of treats come out of the cupboard because they now it's the soft stuff or the small one bite treats and they are more receptive to training and their sessions go much faster.<br /><br />I would recommend these treats as part of a variety.

I have tried many of the extreme hot sauces, including Mad Dog 357 Silver Edition, which is WAY too hot to even enjoy or consume.  I keep that sauce strictly as a novelty or something to dare friends to try.  But I read about this sauce, Pure Ghost and decided to give it a try.  I opened the bottle and the first thing I smelled was vinegar, then came the scent of garlic.  It actually smells dominant in the 2 ingredients.  I was seriously afraid to try this sauce, being its habanero and ghost pepper based.  I saw some youtube videos of people taking it by the teaspoon full and hiccuping and totally spazzing.  I also read reviews of people mocking the sauce and saying its not hot at all and say they are disappointed with the heat level, so I was certainly getting mixed opinions about it.  But I fear no ghost, so I filled my spoon full of it, took a deep breath and went for it.  What happened next?  Delight!  I held it in my mouth for 10 seconds (easily) and swallowed.  The blend of flavors was quite good.  No dominant flavor, yet heavy in garlic and vinegar, as stated, but that does not make the sauce unbearable one bit.  The flavor was really good, as I enjoy it on burgers.  The heat is what I consider to be ""just right"" meaning its not to the point you make a B-Line to the fridge to chug a gallon of milk.  I didn't even need any milk, or water for that matter.  I didn't need anything, I sat and enjoyed the flavor AND the heat as well.  Its a nice burn that lingers for a little while.  I swear I will always have a bottle of this around.  I am now even more tempted to try the other Mad Dog Ghost Pepper sauce, hopefully its just as good, if not better.  I hear Dave's Ghost Sauce is not as hot but tastes better, so that's a MUST buy.  I recommend this sauce to anyone that is a pepperhead or enjoys a good hot wing sauce.  This is nowhere near as hot as Mad Dog 357 Silver, for those of you that have tried it.  So for good flavor and just the right amount of heat, try this.  I can honestly say that even Quaker Steak and Lube's Atomic Sauce is hotter than this, where if I eat just a glob on a pretzel, I start panting.  If you can do that sauce, this will be a piece of cake.  Seriously, what are you waiting for?  Get yourself some of this!  If you wanna try Ghost Pepper/Bhut Jolokia flavor without the excruciating pain, this is the sauce for you."

I am a mom of four children, all born with 5.5 years of one another.  I used pouches for the first time with my latest baby, now one year old at the time of this writing.  Anyhow, since the pouches can be somewhat pricey, I opted to buy a box off of Amazon.  I am pleased with the product and the price, which saved money through the Subscribe and Save program Amazon offers.  I especially like HappyTot because its organic, and the different combinations of fruit/veggies has proved to be appealing to my child.  In addition to this, the addition of salba seed offers some fiber and extra nutrition.  I feel good that I can trust the contents of what I am giving my little one.  Once a baby can hold a cup, I would recommend giving them a pouch too.  In time, it has proven helpful, as opposed to spoon feeding."

It just seems to me that there is no need to use cashews in this product, peanuts would do just fine since the salt and pepper flavors completely dominate this product."

The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: ""Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.""<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough.

It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me---but everyone should know this in case they are allergic. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and don't mind a few additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />This 100 count box is an economical way to enjoy this tea; however, I would try it first in a smaller quantity to be sure before you go for bulk!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****"

The senior cat--a fussy eater with no teeth--was eating another brand of canned cat food, but preferred to ""gum"" dry kibble most of the time.  When I bought the Science Diet, she enjoyed it right away and now prefers it exclusively.  In retrospect, I believe the other brand may have been upsetting her stomach; she slept all the time, had issues with hairballs and was not interested in play at all.  I had attributed this behavior to her age, but since I switched her to the Science Diet she has begun to play again and her coat is extremely soft and shining.  The hairballs have stopped entirely.  I'm very glad I bought it.  (All of that said, the young cat will not touch it.)  So you might test it out before buying in quantity.  Overall, I'm thrilled with what it has done for my senior cat."

I have 3 chihuahuas and 2 are fed Sojos complete and one is a puppy who is moving over to it this week.  I can't say enough about this food.  First of all, it has a ""born on"" date right on the bag, easy to see.  I have never bought a bag that was more than a month old and when I ordered from Amazon my bag was literally only 1 week old from production.  (I was a little worried about that).  The food smells like chicken pot pie and sort of looks like it too.  My dogs are ridiculously picky to the point of my littlest chi being underweight.  I think it was a combination of them waiting for the kids to give them scraps and then they wouldn't touch their food.  I have tried several different brands and cost was irrelevant to me (due to their size, they don't eat much so it isn't a factor).  I tried one that was a dehydrated raw and it smelled like organs so bad, that I would gag when I put it out.  Fortunately for me, the dogs had about the same reaction.  They have taken to this food really well and I have noticed that they shed less and have a ton of energy.  Poops are fine and truly not as smelly either.  My older chi was getting a little chunky and he has slimmed down with this as well as I think being grain free, they are only getting necessary nutrients and not filler.  I like that you can actually recognize what the food is versus the pureed type of foods.  I truly see no need to look further.  I believe in the raw diet but know that there is no way I'm going to be feeding my dogs all those organs, meat, bones etc.  I have a hard enough time making dinners for my family.  LOL  I also mix up a couple of days worth in a twist lock container and just pour it in the bowl.  Easy as pie.  I highly recommend this food."

With this, you don't have to worry about that issue as the dogs seem to chew this type of hide easily yet not losing any enjoyment. Would highly recommend to anyone that worries about this issue."

I have chosen to build my immune system exclusively and not put 1 drop of chemo-poison, radiation-poison, or surgery/cutting approach and I am using this product to help me in my healing and recovery.  This oil also tastes fantastic. I eat my delicious Budwig mix with nuts, hemp seed, cinnamon and love the taste and it fills me up all day.  I had heard taking this oil takes away hunger craves and it has for me. It is very green in color which means it has many good anti-oxidants present too. I had been buying and using allot of flax oil but I much prefer this oil and know Nutiva is a very reputable company and Hemp Oil is without question the healthiest oil one can take.  The price of this product is very reasonable and much less expensive than flax oil as well, about 1/2 the cost. I ordered the 1 Gallon container and will be buying more.  The more you read and research Hemp Oil the more likely you'll be to buy and use it. I am well pleased with this vendor as well.  Will update this entry after my next MRI and share results."

The Emerald product line was started by the company in 2003 to market their products to a more upscale consumer segment, where Emerald trades on the particular hipster, dinner-party image that their products sometime bring to mind.<br /><br />Emerald roasted almonds come packaged in durable 11-ounce canisters with screw-on tops to help keep the product fresh (and, it should be noted, indented sides so that one's hands can easily grasp the container even if one has previously imbibed a few cocktails). Sampling the contents, I was not disappointed; I found the almonds to be as flavorful and addictive as they can be. Interestingly, Emerald also chose to provide a variety of flavoring options such as dark chocolate to help keep things interesting for us. Bravo!<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you like almonds, buying the Emerald product should be an easy decision for you to make. Highly recommended!"

It's got a strong, bold flavor. It has a thick, creamy consistency. It has a nice spiciness to it, about the equivalent of Tapatio. I tried it on tostadas, chicken burritos, and as a salad dressing for a simple lettuce, carrot, tomato and cucumber mix. I felt I gave it enough opportunities. It's just not for me.<br /><br />It has a chemical flavor to me, like I find with Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing. The ingredients are: soybean oil, water, whey (from  milk), vinegar, dried buttermilk, salt, egg yolks, sugar, spice, dried tomato, modified food starch, dried garlic, garlic juice, dried onions, xanthan gum, citric acid, yeast extract, phosphoric acid, gum arabic, corn syrup, disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate, natural flavor, artificial color, sorbic acid and calcium disodium edta as preservatives.  I'm not sure what flavor I am picking up on, but it's enough to make me not want to eat it any more. It really is the same thing I taste with cream-based dressings that are bought at room temperature, so maybe it is the dried milk or some preservative.<br /><br />If you like Hidden Valley Ranch or similar dressings and would like a spicy ranchero sauce, this could definitely be the sauce for you."

In the fifteen years of being a vegetarian, I have consumed a lot of vegetarian gravies.  Some were good and others downright awful.  I recently picked up two of Hain's vegetarian gravy mixes -- one packet of the chicken flavored and one packet of the brown gravy.  I tried the chicken flavor today and it was fantastic.  I cannot wait to try the brown gravy.  I love mashed potatoes and having an excellent gravy is simply joyous for me.  I will probably be eating mashed potatoes for the next month.<br /><br />The gravy cooks up quickly and the only ingredient you need to complete your gravy is water.  The packet produces a cup of gravy (four servings total) and, depending on your stove, can take less than five minutes to whip up.<br /><br />What is a little disappointing to me is that I will not be able to offer this to some of my family members as they are vegan.  (This product contains milk.)  I also found that you had to be prompt about serving the gravy once off the stove.  It can congeal and become lumpy once removed from heat. In addition, a single packet does not yield much product.  Due to the tendency of the product to congeal, I did add a little extra water, which made the gravy a little smoother and, naturally, provided a little more gravy."

There are 2 main reasons i continue to buy it:<br />1. The dogs never have gas problems, and 2. Their stools are always firm and easy to pick up.<br /><br />Whenever we've tried something else (yes, we used high quality food, switched gradually, and gave them time to adjust) that has not been the case.  It gets expensive to feed this food to two 75 pound dogs, so some day we'll probably try again to find a cheaper alternative.  But in the meantime, there is an obvious difference in the dogs digestive health, so I highly recommend Nutro Natural Choice Lite."

Here's what she had to say:<br /><br />I had never heard of the Clear brand before and had some doubt about the quality level. My doubt came from the low price and sort-of-cheap bottle design. I usually pay $10 to $20 for a bottle of conditioner from name brands such as Frederic Fekkai, Paul Mitchell, Redken, Pureology and The Body Shop. I didn't think it fair to compare Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Daily Conditioner with products in this price range, but I can say that the quality of the Clear conditioner is comparable with some of the conditioners mentioned above. It has nice fragrance, conditions my hair with only a small amount of liquid, makes my hair look healthy and shiny, and after using for a week, it made my hair more manageable when used together with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8A2"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>. Although I won't say the quality of Clear conditioner is equal or better than my favorites, I can say the cost performance of Clear conditioner is great. The only thing I don't like is the bottle design. I don't like the inexpensive-looking (well, it is inexpensive), light lavender-color, curved-shape bottle. Although I thought it's a smart idea to place the dispenser at the bottom, I wish it had a nozzle dispenser or round shape so that it's easier to hold with wet hands. When I have an empty bottle of one of my regular shampoos, I may transfer the liquid to it so that my bathroom looks better and I feel better!"

This cooks up in maybe fifteen minutes.<br /><br />Only drawback, which may not be a nuisance to you, is that preparation as directed uses two pans, one to boil the liquid ingredients and a second to griddle up the kasha with egg coating before combining the two into one pan.

I added a very large boneless chicken breast in bite-sized pieces (much less in quantity than the recommended amount of beef) and added diced onions, sliced carrots, peas, and diced sweet potato.  I was tempted to make it a totally vegetarian meal, because my husband will not eat beef, and he really does not like meat much at all.  but for flavor, and to cut fat, I cooked the chicken and veggies in a bit of coconut oil.  Delicious.  It's true that the coconut powder gets lumpy, but I followed some advice to whisk it up prior to adding it.  Tasted similar to the veggie curry I make with curry paste and coconut milk, but not quite as creamy.  The added crunchiness of some of the ingredients (peanuts, coconut) added to that made it even more appealing.<br /><br />I just love coconut curry.  There is something about the savory/spicy/sweetness that is appealing to me.  I added more chili from a spice bottle.  I don't have experience with the ""real thing"", as I don't travel to other countries, or try many ethnic restaurants.  I just knew this was a coconut curry, and that is how I prepare it.  The chicken was so flavorful, as were the vegetables. (the sweet potato -- WOW!) The sauce permeates everything.  Very fragrant.<br /><br />I have been going back and forth in my mind about the price.  I decided that since I am the only curry lover in this house, it just doesn't pay to get the curry paste jars and store them.  Coconut milk, which IS creamier, I do buy the premium brand.  So, it is costly to buy the ingredients to make it by scratch if you aren't going to use the rest of the curry paste before it goes bad.  If you add the peanuts and such to the cost per package, you are talking bucks!<br /><br />So, for a novelty, I believe the price is justified.  This package makes quite a bit, so after two people eating, there are leftovers, and I froze them immediately after cooling.  Heated back up, the consistency isn't as good, but passable.<br /><br />I would buy this, but just not in a case.  I have no room.  The only cases I buy from Amazon (and I shop here a lot) are of bottles of a name brand jalapeno sauce.  I go through that fast!  But if you want a good curry, and you eat it a lot, I recommend buying it from Amazon."

Obviously jello from scratch is better but it doesn't do very well unrefrigerated (like in a school lunch bag).<br /><br />FYI,<br /><br />1. Amazon calls this a ""24 pack"" which is actually 6 packs of 4 cups each that totals 24 cups per order.<br /><br />2. I ordered this product when the temp. outside was in the low 90's and the jello didn't seem to be affected. I don't know how it would hold up in the high 90's to 100's since it has to travel around in the truck all day in the heat."

I waited for a reaction -- nothing untoward happened. They licked their chops and came after me for more of the same.<br /><br />Now, it has been noted that there is alot of ""water"" (Broth) in this can of Chicken pot Pie -- I am familiar with ""Spot's Stew"" and that brand also has alot of liquid in its can. I have no problem with this Chicken Pot Pie broth -- if anything, it helps to hydrate my kitties (cats, being descended from desert animals -- get most of their liquid from their food-- and as long as the sodium content of this broth is low, then they can slurp it to their hearts delight -- and they certainly did, as the dishes were licked clean)<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken, was less liquidy and looked very nice, shredded with its vegetables -- it had special smell, which actually was just the smell of Sesame Oil. But my cats inhaled this as greedily as they did the Chicken pot Pie. I was impressed that Sesame oil would be used (along with Soy oil) as an ingredient. I'm looking forward to seeing what these oils will eventually do to nourish (former abandoned, street-kitty, but thoroughly vetted) Cee Cee's somewhat dull coat. * * *<br /><br />And to top off the Petite Cuisine experience, each box comes with a coupon worth $2 -- $1 off when you buy a four-pack, or four cans of Petite Cuisine from the supermarket -- and another $1 coupon will be sent to you if you fill out your name and address on the first coupon before you present it to  the check out clerk.<br /><br />The only thing I take an issue with is the origin -- Thailand -- why not keep this ""at home"" and produce it in the USA?<br /><br />* * *UPDATE -- Dec 18 2008 -- Cee Cee's coat grew out a little more, is BEAUTIFUL and silky!! Since the only new thing in her life is this food, I can surmise that this diet of Petite Cuisine DID help flesh her out and beautify her fur (She is a former street-kitty, and has always been a little wan (although she goes to the vet regularly) since she was rescued and I brought her inside.)"

So even though the cost per bag is high, it is really no more expensive than ""normal"" brands in the long run. Watch for weight gain in larger dogs, my friend tried this stuff with his big Lab mix and he put on to much weight. My only complaint would be that my dogs coat doesnt seem to shine like it did with some other brands. I now top this food off with a squirt of salmon oil and her coat really shines. The best thing about this food is that my dog just loves the taste. I would recommend trying."

I really liked it.  Although I dislike ""hot"" spicy foods, featuring ingredients such as chilis or cumin, I do find that I can enjoy those ""cool"" spicy foods like horseradish and wasabi.  To me, while they have a bite, they also seem to have a bit of a fresh breeze quality to them.  I suppose these spices help to clear the breathing passages.<br /><br />In any event - this is essentially a very mild cheese, with a mild horseradish effect (not so bland that you can't taste it, but not overwhelming).  I've had this cheese by itself on rye flatbread, which is an appealing and satisfying snack; on oatcakes (crackers) - again, very tasty and filling; and also with salmon salad on rye flatbread, which it suited very well.  I think this is a good cheese for using with fish because of the horseradish.<br /><br />The cheese is firmish, but not hard, crumbly or ""snappy"" - it cuts with a bit of a soft folding quality when at room temperature.  It has a very nice, creamy, even texture, is not mushy or sticky or otherwise unpleasant.  It seemed very fresh and the horseradish taste was very fresh and natural as well - there is no weird chemical effect or aftertaste - all in all very nicely done."

My favorite use is a final cup of coffee in the evening after dinner. Rather than make an entire pot, the T-Disc permit a freshly brewed single cup.<br /><br />Although I am not a total fanatic, when making a full pot, I do grind coffee beans just before brewing coffee, use filtered water, and keep everything quite clean in order to obtain the best taste possible. My preference is strong bold coffee. When it comes to T-Discs I normally stick with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WD93EW"">Starbucks Africa Kitamu Coffee (Bold), 12-Count T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers (Pack of 2) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WDCAJ2"">Starbucks Caffe Verona Coffee (Bold), 12-Count T-Discs for Tassimo Coffeemakers (Pack of 2) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]. Of course, the difference between what one person thinks is good and another thinks is drek, is, well, a matter of taste.<br /><br />After dinner, I've often reached my caffeine limit for the day. Currently, there are only two decaffeinated T-Discs available -- Maxwell House and Gevalia. Normally I probably would not buy Maxwell House coffee but after plowing through a free sampler pack of Gevalia T-discs that was included with my Tassimo, I found the taste too harshly acidic. Perhaps with cream and sugar it is improved? I don't know, but since I drink my coffee black, it's irrelevant.<br /><br />I find the Maxwell House disc to be smooth and surprisingly good. I realize that different notes in coffee appeal to different palates, so keep that in mind. I certainly hope the future brings other decaffeinated varieties to choose from, but for the time being, I am quite happy."

Graham crackers are not as flavorful, but they also don't leave bits of fruit, whether raisins or figs, stuck between your teeth.<br /><br />Also, neither type of fruit niblet stuck between your teeth tastes like any particular type of fruit, i.e., the little bits taste just as much like raisin as fig or vice versa.  The ""fig and honey natural flavor and other natural flavor"" -- which is exactly what the box proudly if confusingly says on the front in the upper left corner -- could just as well be labelled as ""strawberry and caramel"" or ""peach and cinnamon"" and it wouldn't make any difference to what you taste.<br /><br />Unlike graham crackers, these Newtons Fruit Thins Fig and Honey dip into milk nicely, without breaking off to frustrate you.  Also, they do not readily crumble when snapped into pieces or bitten.<br /><br />Another consideration is price.  Graham crackers cost around $3.25 for a 14-ounce box, or 23 cents an ounce.  These ""fruit thins"" crackers cost around 60 cents per ounce, or 160% more, not counting your toothpick and dental floss expense<br /><br />If you're expecting a lot of fig flavor or a lot of honey flavor in a cracker, and especially if you're expecting to discern both, and even if you're expecting only a little of one or the other, this is probably not your best choice.  A better choice would be to spread a saltine or a graham cracker with fig jam and drizzle it with honey.<br /><br />Of course, I'm pretty sure that involves getting fig jam and honey.  And, unless you have really unusual table manners, a knife.<br /><br />Anyway, meh.<br /><br />P.S. I just noticed that on an Amazon decription page for this product, as of right now you can buy ""6 used & new for $18.22.""  The only meaning I can come up with for a used cracker involves the digestive system and what I'm pretty sure is a medical impossibility.  If it is not an impossibility, I would pay a lot more than $18.22 not to have to consume even one used cracker, no matter the brand."

I thought perhaps there was just a great deal of raisins in them!  However upon opening the first jar, I was quite wrong.  It seems that all the raisins had settled to the bottom, making me dig through the entire jar to the very bottom where they had all settled and smashed.<br /><br />Though I would have expected better mixing from a premium product like this, it was not the worst part.  Once I decided to try the peanut butter itself it had a VERY gritty texture, so bad that I had to spit it out afterward.  It was like a mouth full of peanut butter flavored sand.  Every bite was like chewing on a mouth full of sugar crystals.  All of the jars seemed to have the problem with the raisins being settled to the bottom, however I did not take a taste from each of them as well.<br /><br />I would have given one star, but Amazon was very quick and easy in resolving the matter for me, so they get an extra one for that!

The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.

He seemed to like Nature's Choice Farm Stand Selects and Nutro Ultra food, but only for sampling. He's always happy to find a bowl full of Eagle there waiting for him to take of it.<br /><br />Regarding ingredients and supplements, Eagle Pack Super Premium is the far best of all. And the fact that it is specially balanced for Giant Breed dogs is something that You won't find anywhere else.<br /><br />Consider this food for Your Giant Breed best friend. Look at the labels, check the ingredients, read about protein balance and other stuff that your dog needs. I guarantee that You won;t find any other food that will come close to Eagle Pack.

Overpriced by most opinions and now the money could be better used for gas. Buy a Senseo Machine. Simple latte with great flavor from the Senseo pods..foam and all..Coffee from Belgium..beats all including Gevalia which is a rip off at more than 15.00 a pound? Senseo comes out to about .50 cents or less per 8oz serving. Only Dunkin Donuts Turbo might be as good, but again expensive. Buy some paper cups with lock lids and take it with you in the car. Some of you are spending more than $1300.00 a year on Starbucks. Forget about it. The Senseo machine can be found for half price (35.00) at some sites (NIB) and if you subscribe to the Amazon pod subscription, you will not find the Douwe Egberts pods cheaper anywhere. Makes great ice coffee, using the dark roast pods and the shaker with ice method...vietnamese style with sweet condensed milk...can't be beat...Decaf pods are medium roasted and perfect for the nightly ice coffee late in the evening. Try it. A Starbucks is a gallon of gas sometimes. Don't cry poor mouth while downing an ultra lite soy caramel grande something or other for 5.00 at Starbucks or do you need to be seen there and the coffee is of no importance. The medium roast is perfection but the dark for strong coffee lovers is strong and just below the bitter line where it should be. Brew a 4 or 8 ounce serving and drink it ASAP at the perfect temperature. If you are taking it with you, nuke it for less than 12 seconds on high. I use half n half...use what you like. I don't add flavors, liquid or powder..Coffee is the flavor I am looking for and it is in there naturally. Flavors syrups belong on ice cream or waffles, not in coffee. Just try it..You can even add scalded milk if you like. Remember scalded is below boiling. Keep the stir going until you see tiny bubbles.ok enough."

I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea."

We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors."

This item is one of the low cal snacks that I received and would re order again. These very tasty cinnamon danish bars are perfect when I am in the mood for something sweet without having to worry about weight gain. The hard part is not eating all of them at once, but since I am used to dieting I am able to savor one bar at a time a few times a week.  They taste very much like a cinnamon danish.  However, the consistency is not at all like that of a danish. They are somewhat chewy and yet soft and creamy.  I know this sounds contradictory but they do have an unusual and delicious slight amount of chewiness which does add a degree of eating something more substantial then your ordinary low cal thin pastry snack. Obviously cinnamon is the predominant flavor and if you are not a fan then these are not for you. I am very happy I found these on Amazon.  They are a welcome change from the low cal snack cakes I am used to. They are great by themselves or with a beverage. So if you are a fan of the flavor of cinnamon and are watching your calories, try them. Your taste buds will thank you."

I will post a picture if I can figure out how. There were pieces of stems beyond the bud.  Piece of leaves of the were clearly not baby buds but of mature leaves.  Lots of brown colors there were pieces of leaves that were clearly not beautiful fuzzy little friends.  The buds that were there were more yellow than the delicate green.<br /><br />brew:  there was lots of debris/particulate in the first few brews.  the brew lacked delicate aroma and its color was off darker than I'm used to.  the flavor was more earthy than delicate reminding me of a strong cheap green tea. this tea also lacked exquisite sweat flavors/aromas that I so love about silver needle teas.<br /><br />on a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this tea and 1.5 or 2.

We were excited for the opportunity to try different blends before purchasing an entire (pricey) box of any one flavor.<br /><br />To preface: I enjoy flavored coffees. French vanilla, mocha, hazelnut... Pretty much any variety available. I was really excited to try Gloria Jean's Hazelnut since it was one of the few flavored options in the sample pack. I typically enjoy smooth medium roasts and I can't stand bitter coffee with a pungent aftertaste.<br /><br />Unfortunately, though, this brew is without-a-doubt undrinkable. So bitter and thick. I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend. It smelled burnt as soon as it was brewed. We brewed an 8 ounce cup since typically flavored coffees tend to be weaker so we assumed brewing the smaller size cup would allow us to enjoy to most flavor. The coffee was dark in appearance and both my boyfriend and I tried it befor dumping it out in the sink because the taste was so foul.<br /><br />Aside from its burnt flavor and bitter aftertaste, it's also worth mentioning that I couldn't detect any hazelnut notes at all. Very disappointing.<br /><br />I'd never tried a Gloria Jean brand coffee before and now I'm nervous to try another. I might attempt the Butter Toffee flavor if I can find it in a small pack.

That way the seaweed doesn't get soft and mushy because of the moisture in the rice.

Went through Puppy Chow, generic puppy chow, and Iams and then I started reading up on dog foods- and boy, did I learn a lot! No more grocery store food unless it is an ""emergency"" where getting online is not possible or we run out before the shipment arrives. That stuff is pure crap.<br /><br />We then went through a bag of Orijen, which I think is an excellent food, but not for her. She would eat it with toppings only and rarely ate all of it. Stools were often loose- not to mention the gas.<br /><br />A tiny dog can only eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of food per day so he/she needs to eat it all and it needs to be packed with nutrition. Back to the drawing board since the Orijen didn't work!<br /><br />Next we tried the Wellness Super5Mix Adult Small Breed. She eats every bite and licks the dish and sometimes wants an evening snack of the plain Wellness kibble. She eats it without any topping but I do usually mix in a TBS of wet food (or cottage cheese) which Wellness recommends in order to give the dog a bit of extra fluid. We live in the desert, so that's important. Anyway, she REALLY loves that! She has cleaned her plate twice daily ever since I started her on this wonderful food. The stools are formed and no gas.<br /><br />It seems to be the perfect food for her- and maybe for other dogs too which is why I am writing this. It is such a relief to see her eating a good nutritious dog food and enjoying it.<br /><br />I would definitely give it a try if your dog has ""pickyness""/appetite/digestion issues, or if you just want to provide 4 star nutrition. It costs more than the grocery store stuff, but a small dog doesn't eat much so I make it fit into my budget. I try to include it in with the occasional larger Amazon order and get  free shipping. It may be available in pet stores as well, but I have to go 15-20 miles out of town to find a pet store, so ordering online is easier.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this food."

When I was searching for a healthier between meal afternoon snack I read a lot of reviews for a lot of products.  I wanted something with few ingredients, not ""fortified"" and with some nuts in it.  I settled on these Larabar Fruit & Nut Cherry Pie bars and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P504ZG"">Pure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry Living Food Bar</a>.  I love cherries and I love blueberries so they seemed like good choices.<br /><br />The stats of the bars are very similar, weight (both 1.7oz, not 1.8), calories, fat, sugars, etc.  The PURE has more protein at 6g vs 4g.  The Larabar has no sodium while the PURE has just a bit at 5mg.  The Larabar is thicker, the PURE bar is wider.  Visually the Larabar appears to have more nuts in it, which doesn't seem to jive with the protein stats.  The PURE bar has a grittier texture while chewing so maybe more of the nuts are finely ground.<br /><br />1st ingredient is dates for both followed by almonds and then cherries for the Larabar and followed by blueberries and various nuts, organic agave nectar, rice protein and lemon juice for the PURE bar.  One would think with the extra ingredients in the PURE bar they were added to tweak the flavor or give it a fresher taste, but the flavor of the Larabar is better than the PURE by a pretty good margin.  It has a much fresher and lively taste.  I have to say the PURE bar is a bit cardboardy tasting to me and has a drier mouth feel.  It is not bad, in fact my 2 youngest kids eat them readily, just not nearly as good as the Larabar.  I think the tartness of the cherries in the Larabar kick up the flavor vs the milder blueberry flavor of the PURE (maybe the lemon juice add as an attempt to kick up the PURE bar flavor and tartness?).  In fairness I should probably review the PURE Cherry Cashew bar but I much prefer almonds over cashews so don't plan on ordering any from Amazon.  If I stumble on the PURE cherry in a regular store I will give one a try thugh.  I still get both auto shipped from Amazon for variety sake, but am looking for a better tasting blueberry bar w/ basic ingredients including nuts.<br /><br />For grins here is a comparison of the Larabar, PURE, Snickers, Hershey's and Maruchan Chicken Ramen noodles in a few categories.

It had too much of a chemical-y taste to it and just didn't seem to live up to all of the hype that had been going on about it. I decided to give the mix another try via Vine, so I tried this flavor. The flavor is about what I expected as well as a little better.<br /><br />The good about this flavor is that it's drinkable. If you're any type of Southern person then you're going to be disappointed in some regards to this flavor because it doesn't come close to matching real sweet tea, so don't even begin to have any hopes for that. However, apart from that this actually isn't that bad flavor-wise. Yes, you can instantly tell that this is a mix of chemical tastes rather than a tall glass of proper sweet tea, but for a chemical drink it isn't bad. I actually didn't mind finishing off the glass I'd made.<br /><br />The bad is that the mix looks completely unappetizing going into the water and that somehow I still felt thirsty after drinking this up. It looks pretty much like a bunch of chemicals mixing in with water, but most importantly the chemicals seemed to irritate my throat a little and make me feel like I was still thirsty. However, I'm more than willing to accept that maybe it's just my mind playing tricks on me.<br /><br />Overall this isn't bad, but it isn't great either. If it's on sale I might pick this flavor up to throw in a picnic basket and as far as non-real sweet tea goes, it's not bad. It's just that this isn't exactly something I want to run out and buy either."

I'm not sure if I was supposed to get Golden or PB, but I'll review the one I got.<br /><br />Why does Nabisco even use the Oreo name for these cookies? They taste good, but they're nothing like an Oreo. The creme isn't like Oreo creme, the single, extra-thin cookie wafer isn't anything like the two thick cookie wafers you get with an actual Oreo, and they're covered in chocolate. Honestly, I don't understand the marketing for this product at all. They took a cookie that has absolutely nothing to do with Oreos and called it an Oreo solely for the product recognition on store shelves. Frankly, it's annoying.<br /><br />So if you're looking for something that tastes anything like an Oreo cookie, this is not it.<br /><br />Do I like them?  Yes. They're OK. They're like the peanut butter Girl Scout cookies. I would probably refrain from buying them again, though. The number of cookies in the package is slightly disappointing, considering the price. I can find the same kind of cookie in a much more cost-effective package without the Oreo name to pump up the price.<br /><br />These are good peanut butter cookies (the ones I got were, anyway) but I was expecting a package of Oreos and got something that bears no resemblance to them. I'd rather they just sold them under a different name, and left the name ""Oreo"" to the familiar cookie with *two* chocolate wafers and a creme center."

He uses them when he's going to go out drinking with his buddies to avoid the next day hangover.  I've tried it for this purpose too but I couldn't vouch for it as much as he does because I've never experienced a real hangover just the occasional headache which I fix with a couple of aspirin.  He did use to get the whole spectrum of the hangover rainbow symptom (vomiting, nausea, headache, sensitivity to light and sound, dizziness, etc).  He swears that ever since he started drinking 5-hour energy before a night of drinking he's reduced his next day symptoms.  I do see him a bit more functional the next day and whether it's a placebo effect or an actual effect of 5-hour energy is disputable of course but I'm not claiming scientific certainty just personal experience.<br /><br />He also uses them in place of coffee when he's in a hurry and doesn't have time to make coffee.  Coffee in our household is more of an enjoyment but of course we do have the little caffeine habit that affects our productivity.  I actually do feel the same replacing one of these for a cup of coffee but nothing bits the deliciousness of a cup of coffee (the flavor of this thing is mediocre at best and absolutely horrendous at worst).  I've actually made the mistake of mixing a cup of coffee with one of these and I did feel jittery but if you just take the 5-hour energy without extra caffeine you should be OK. Of course if you are pretty much immune to caffeine at this point, both products at the same time won't make much of a difference.  I would be careful to drink more than two per day just because of the amount of vitamins contained in it.  You never know what kind of side effects you can get from OD'ing on vitamins.<br /><br />If you can get past the horrible flavor, I'd recommend it, otherwise stick to coffee."

As a first time mom, I had high hopes of making my baby's own baby food, but once I returned to work, I felt as though I wouldn't have the time. Then a coworker recommended the Beaba to me, and I am so glad he did. It is a bit pricey, so I bought a used one, and as one reviewer pointed out, the water reserve did have some brown stuff in it. In order to clean the reserve, I used hot water and a toothbrush and scrubbed it all out. I have NEVER seen any of the brown get into the water after the steaming. Since I bought the item used, it didn't come with the manual, but it is so easy to use, that I didn't need one! After my first use, I was in love. For a full time working mom, this steamer blender makes me feel as though I was able to slave away in the kitchen all day to make the best possible food for my baby. Carrots and potatoes only take about 20 mins to steam, and then maybe 2 mins to blend up, so to all the people who say that it isn't big enough, how much food do you need to make?! I am able to make over 12 ounces at a time. Besides, this means that I can change it up for my little one so she doesn't have to eat the same thing day in and day out. And for all the naysayers out there saying that you get the same results with a blender and steamer, you're right. But you can wash dishes by hand too, or use the dishwasher!

I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.

I asked the vet, and she said it's true, but she wouldn't say it's common.  She said to go with chicken and save the lamb and bison as alternatives IF she would become allergic.  So then WC became my #1 choice.  It's grain free which I liked.  (With all my research on how grais affect people, I thought this would be wise.) So we picked up the food, picked up our new puppy and started the half and half with the dog food the breeder was giving (as they recommend a slow...one week...transition of the one food into the other food).  After all the research I almost cried as I poured in the ""other brand"" (knowing how bad all the fillers/corn/garbage was in the other stuff).  So we only went two days with the mixing, then I went to straight WCore.  She did great (7 and half weeks at this point)!  Never had any digestion problems, never had any loose stools.  I am hoping for the miracle food that everyone is claiming that it will produce much better fur and low dander.  We've bathed her 3 times in one week (I know, a bit compulsive) and she has no skin problems.  She is a little over 8 lbs. now, and just moved up to about a cup a day.  So they do eat less than the typical dog food.  The ""other brand"" was recommending almost 2 cups while WC was right on track with what she was eating at 1 cup/ day (divided into thirds or fourths throughout the day).  So I feel a little better spending the extra money knowing that it's lasting me longer than the typical bag of ""other brand"" dog food.  Love that the ingredients are healthy!  The only hangup I had was a comment I had read that their dog didn't like it.  I wasn't spending sixty dollars to find out she didn't like it.  I called customer service and she explained I would have a money back guarantee.  So that sealed the deal.  Our lab mix loves it, and we haven't looked back."

After doing a tiny amount of research on cat nutrition I was absolutely disgusted with myself for feeding this food to my cat for over 3 years.  I am also disgusted that so many veterinarians have apparently been bought off by the Hill's company.<br /><br />This Science Diet formula's first 8 ingredients:<br />1 - Brewers rice: Filler. Processed rice product that is missing many of the nutrients contained in whole ground rice. (Cat's don't need grain, and this is the first ingredient!)<br />2 - Chicken By Product Meal: Parts of chicken not fit for human consumption, i.e. head, feet, bones, entrails, blood, intestines, etc.<br />3 - Corn Gluten Meal: Corn byproduct used as an inexpensive protein source.  Many cats and dogs are allergic to corn and, again, cats are carnivores and do not need grain.<br />4 - Powdered Cellulose:  Sawdust!<br />5 - Ground Whole Grain Corn:  More cheap, HYPER allergenic grain that cats don't need.<br />6 - Chicken Liver Flavor:  Self explanatory, but why not just use real chicken liver?<br />7 - Animal Fat: Fat from an unnamed animal source, most likely fat from many types of animals that the Hills company would rather not name.<br />8 - Soybean Mill Run: Soybean hulls - a cheap, byproduct filler.  Soy is also highly allergenic.<br /><br />The funny thing - anyone who buys Science Diet knows it's pretty expensive food.  Yet we can all reasonably presume that these fillers and byproducts probably aren't that expensive to source.  What's worse is that this food can cause serious health problems like diabetes due to the ridiculously high amount of carbohydrates (aka sugars).  The guaranteed analysis on the Hill's website indicates this food is composed of 43.2% carbohydrates.  That's completely inappropriate for the nutritional needs of cats.<br /><br />I was lucky to ""see the light"" before my cat developed any serious health problems from this food.  My cats symptoms on Science Diet were fairly mild, but still concerning - she got fatter and fatter, she was inactive, her coat was dull, and she pooped a lot.  The first food I switched her to was Taste of the Wild Rocky Mountain Formula, which is a grain-free, high protein diet that costs about half the price of Science Diet.  The first 8 ingredients of Taste of the Wild are chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat, pea protein, potato protein, roasted venison, smoked salmon.  Obvious improvement over Science Diet's ingredients.  My cat loved it, started losing weight, more activity, coat became shiner, and there were litter box benefits as well (less poo because she was no longer eating filler that her body couldn't process).  I absolutely feel Taste of the Wild is an amazing value for grain-free cat food and a vastly superior product compared to Science Diet and most other commercial cat foods.<br /><br />A few months ago I found Orijen cat food and decided to switch again.  The first 8 ingredients of Orijen are fresh boneless chicken, chicken meal, fresh boneless salmon, turkey meal, fresh chicken liver, herring meal, russet potato, chicken fat.  Now doesn't the Orijen ingredient list make the Science Diet ingredients above even more laughable and sad?  After feeding Orijen and a bit of high-quality canned food every day (Tiki Cat or Nature's Variety Instict), my 4 year old cat has practically become a kitten again.  She plays every day and is the picture of lean, bright-eyed, happy feline health.  Changing my cat's diet from Science Diet to a diet appropriate for felines has completely transformed my cat in less than 6 months!<br /><br />There is so much information about feline health out there and so many holistic foods to choose from now.  I strongly believe that anyone who currently feeds Science Diet would feel immediately compelled to switch foods after doing 20-30 minutes of research.  Please do."

The food looks/smells/feels like actual chicken a human would eat, and the kitties love it. While they've always been healthy cats, their coats have gotten even shinier since I've started feeding them an all-wet diet (including Weruva), and they're maintaining a healthy weight and activity level. I'd highly recommend this food to other pet owners, and Amazon's price (with the free shipping) is the best I've seen."

Vanilla may be the only food flavoring that the FDA has developed standards for - which is understandable given that this orchid-derived spice may be the most popular flavor worldwide.  The popularity and use of vanilla extract in cooking and other products undoubtedly resulted in the need to standardize its formulation.<br /><br />Not sure why Amazon continues to advertise this flavoring as an EXTRACT given that the bottle's label fails to identify it as such.  Unfortunately I couldn't read the label shown on the low resolution image of this item on Amazon's website, but after I received shipment of this item I noticed the top of the bottle's front label actually reads ""Watkins Original Vanilla Double Strength - Artificially Flavored"" - and thus it clearly does not identify this product as being an EXTRACT (merely mentioning in the fine print at bottom of front label that it contains vanilla extract).<br /><br />Furthermore, the bottle's back label lists its ingredients - and their order of preponderance shows this flavoring contains more water, sugar and ""propylene glycol"" (a component of anti-freeze!) than vanilla extract!!!<br /><br />Sure would be great if Amazon would correct this item's product description by removing the word ""Extract"" from both its banner and ""product features"" section.  Even better, it should note that the product is ""artificially flavored"" and also list its ingredients in the order of their predominance (i.e., Water, glucose, propylene glycol, vanilla extract (alcohol, water, extractive of vanilla beans), alcohol (8.25%), artificial flavors, caramel color. Contains Sulfites.).<br /><br />Hopefully, no one else will fall prey to this item's false advertisement."

Though no packaged coconut water comes close to the taste of fresh-from-a-tender-coconut water, Zico is the best one I have found so far (have tried many others sold here at Amazon and elsewhere; Vita Coco is the 2nd best in my opinion). Coconut water is awesome in terms of being nutritious and refreshing, and sodas of course don't hold a candle to it. I have tried both the Zico 'natural' (as in no added flavor) and the Zico mango flavored, and must say that the mango flavored one wins hands down. The regular one has a slightly 'cooked' or 'boiled' taste to it (as packaged coconut water is pasteurized), and maybe the mango flavor covers that in the other one. Tastes great whether cool or cold; probably better the colder it is. The mango flavor is very delicate, and does not take away from the coconut water itself, somehow enhancing it and making it even more delicious. Plus, the first time I got this the price was fantastic, 8 dollars off from the usual 24 due to a lightning deal, making this even sweeter (no pun intended, the coconut water has only a touch of sweetness, no added sugar - just the right, natural amount). Hopefully this will be back in stock soon so I can 'subscribe and save' to keep the price low."
